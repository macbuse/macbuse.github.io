Let's move on to our second
method.
)

$x^2$

# Separation of variables

400$ y' = \frac{dy}{dx}$

- !![M](
We are going to viewg this thing as a separable
differential equation.
So generally,  when you do this,  
you use liebnitz 
notation so you write dee y over dee x equals Y.
)

- !![M](
This tells us that we can write dee y over y equals Dee X.
Integrating both sides, we see that natural log of y equals x plus some
constant C. 
)

400$ \frac{dy}{dx}= y \Rightarrow \frac{dy}{y}= {dx} $

# Separation of variables

- !![K](
Now we can exponentiate both sides to give us y equals e to the
X plus C )

- !![K](
And, using the rules for the exponential function, 
we know this can be written
 e to the C times e to the X 
which we can rewrite as constant
times e to the X where I just renamed
that constant e to the c.
)

# Separation of variables
!![M](
Again we'll evaluate this at x equals 0
and we should get 1 which tells us that
the constant  is 1 as before.
)

# Separation of variables
!![K](
Finally we see that y
equals e to the X,
just like it did
before!  Okays?
)

#Done 
!![K](
So now we've solved this as
a separable differential equation.
