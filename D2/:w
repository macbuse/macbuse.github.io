!![K](
Let's move on to our second
method.
)

400$y' = \frac{dy}{dx}$

#
## Leibniz notation

- 200$\frac{dy}{dx}=y$ !![M]( We are going to view this thing as a separable differential equation.  So generally,  when you do this,  you use liebnitz notation so you write dee y over dee x equals Y.)
- 200$\frac{dy}{y}=dx$ !![M]( This tells us that we can write dee y over y equals Dee X.  Now when we integrate both sides, we see that log of y equals x plus some constant C. )
- 200$\log(y) = x + C.$ 



#
### Applying the exponential

- 200$y = e^{(x + C)}.$ !![K](
Now we can exponentiate both sides to give us y equals e to the
X plus C ) 

- 200$y = e^Ce^x = Ae^x$ !![K](
And, from the rules for the exponential function, 
we know this is in fact 
ee to the C times ee to the X.
It is more convenient to write this:
a constant, which I'll call ay, times e to the X
)

#
## so finally..

- 200$y(0)=1 \Rightarrow  A=1$
!![M](
Again the value of  y  at x equals  zero is one
 which tells us that ay is also one. 
)

#
## and...
400$y(x) = e^x$
!![K](
Finally we see that y
equals ee to the X,
just like it did
before!  Okay?
)

#Done 
!![K](
So now we've solved this as
a separable differential equation.
