## Challenges

### Fundamental Mathematics (FM)

Since the time of Newton mathematics has been the universal language of
science. This is especially true in the natural and computational sciences
where the importance  of properly formulating ideas in terms of mathematics
cannot be overstated. Modeling problems that arise in these domains is an
inexhaustible source of mathematical challenges, which not only stimulate the
development of new mathematical concepts, techniques, and algorithms, but
frequently lead to interesting computational questions. Conversely, several
areas of fundamental mathematics take advantage of computational tools, for
instance in obtaining certified and rigorous formal demonstrations of
celebrated theorems, or checking  the validity of important conjectures by
means of high-performance computing. This virtuous circle incorporates all
areas of fundamental mathematics whether that be algebra, analysis,
combinatorics, geometry, or number theory. For instance, geometry and topology,
have an important role in modeling physical problems, whilst analytical,
algebraic, or probabilistic techniques have proven indispensable in resolving
the resulting mathematical questions. The primary goal of the present project
is to build new, and reinforce existing connections made possible by the LabEx
between fundamental mathematics and computational sciences. With this in mind
we  believe that  the following directions are of particular interest:

\- Apply theoretical studies of error correcting codes to improve the reliability of digital communications and data storage in the perspective of post-quantum cryptography;

\- Extend methods in effective algebra using new computational techniques

\- Extend computer-assisted methods in the direction of geometry by using interval arithmetic to study complex geometrical objects;

\- Develop new algorithms and improve existing algorithms for studying the topology and geometry of curves and surfaces;

\- Applications of data science to biostatistics, ecology and evolution;

\- Develop new mathematical techniques, based on stochastic geometry or ergodic theory, to fully understand the information contained in large data sets.

### Modeling, Simulation & Optimization


Applied mathematics is a pivotal discipline at the interface between
fundamental research and applications. It's purpose is to develop theories and
techniques that are applicable in diverse scientific fields, and as such it is
a natural *home* for interdisciplinary projects. There are two essential
ingredients in this process: modelling and simulation. Modelling is concerned
with finding the most appropriate mathematical description of a problem, to
making it tractable for subsequent analysis. Simplification procedures such as
dimension reduction are often needed to allow for a complete analysis or for
efficient computer simulations. As very few “real” problems (eg fluid flows)
can be solved explicitly, simulations play an essential role and require
appropriate discretizations of the problem becomes one of obtaining accurate
approximate solutions. Fundamental concepts are used by applied mathematicians
to analyze the problems and optimize the computed solutions.
