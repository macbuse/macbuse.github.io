# Running

Murakami says that pain is inevitable but suffering is optional. I think that's a good way to look at it. Pain is a part of life, but suffering is a choice. You can choose to suffer or you can choose to accept the pain and move on. It's not easy, but it's possible. And it's worth it.

One **facet** of Buddhism is that it teaches how not to turn pain into suffering. Buddha taught that human life is inherently painful. We all get older, every day. There is nothing we can do about that, however much we might dislike it or slather on anti-ageing potions to hold on to our youthful looks. And with age often comes illness. Again, there is a lot we can do to prevent that, but some illnesses will inevitably come with advancing years.

When you are feeling a painful emotion like anger, upset, loneliness, anxiety or sadness, that emotion will show up somatically, in your body. Compassionate Breathing and a soothing imagery technique to feel a deep sense of peace, as well warmth, love and compassion.

Most people I speak to don't realise that running is not really
about exercising my legs, but about exercising my mind. It's about
breathing, getting to a meditative state, and letting go of all the
stress and anxiety that builds up during the day. 

When I wake up in the morning I plan my day around my run.
Eating, working, and the rest of my activities are fitted around the
run. I check the weather and pollution then decide the distance and
the route. Once all this is done I can begin my day knowing that
I'll have achieved something by the end of it. All the chaotic
madness of work and life will be forgotten for those moments when
I'm alone running, concentrating on breathing and the rhythm of my
footfalls. 

The inherent simplicity, the minimalism of running is what I love.
There can be no other form of exercise that is so simple, so natural
as to run. You don't need particularly special equipment, you don't need a gym subscription, you don't need a trainer. You just need a pair of shoes and the road. Humans are born to run. We have special adaptations compared to other animals that make us the best long distance runners in the animal kingdom. Running is in our DNA. Apes can't run, they don't have the feet we do and can't hold themselves upright for long periods of time that running requires.

Of course running doesn't get any easier as we get older. It does get harder. There numerous aches and pains that come with age. The knees, the back, the hips, the feet. Everything hurts. One must learn to live with this pain but not to suffer. It's a fantastic personal journey to age gracefully and to keep running. Unhealthy people will tell me that I'm ruining my knees or my hips or my back. But I know that I'm doing the best thing for my body. I'm keeping it healthy and strong. I'm keeping it young. I'm keeping it alive. There is much research into ageing and exercise. It's clear that exercise is the best way to keep your body young. The body reacts to the stress of exercise and keeps itself young. It's the best way to keep your mind young. All that careful, tempered breathing improves the circulation of oxygen to the brain. It's the best way to keep your spirit young. The satisfaction of completing a run, the sense of achievement, the sense of freedom, the sense of being alive improve one's sense of self-worth and self-esteem.

Murakami talks about how he ages and how it affects his running. The inevitability of ageing is something that we all have to face. He has a stoic approach to this. Pain is inevitable is a  quintessential Buddhist teaching but it evokes a stoic notion of life which is no longer fashionable in the West where the pursuit of individual pleasure is the norm. The young are self centered and  seek nothing other than to fulfill worldly desires that are fed to them by the old and the new media. The minimalism is alien to all but a few hardy souls. In age one should aspire to be respected for one's wisdom and experience. The young should look up to the old for guidance and advice but instead they turn to each other, to the influencers who preach unrestrained hedonism. The old are left to fend for themselves, to find their own way in a world that has left them behind. The old are left to continue alone,  finding their own path, finding their own peace in the gradual decline of the pace of the life and their runs. 


A day without running is like a day without sunshine or hot water or coffee. I can't imagine my life without running. It's my meditation, my therapy, my joy. It's my way of disconnecting with the world around me, of feeling alive and free. 



There are days when I'm completely  worn down by  things. When I get
a cold or a flu or a stomach bug. My body runs but my spirit is not
there, not physically, not mentally. I run because I have to,
because I need to, not because I want to. Desire is powerful  but
less than need and less than duty. Civilians, that is those who
don't run, don't understand this. They think that running is just a
passtime, a hobby not a necessity. They miss the almost religious
character of donning ones shoes and shuffling off on the road to
salvation.
Of course,
there are days when everything is perfect. The weather is
justbeautiful, the air is clean, the sun is shining, the birds
encourage me with their song. I feel light, I feel free, I feel
wonderful. But then there are days like today when it is almost an
ordeal. My limbs ache, the air is heavy with pollution, and
breathing is not so easy. I feel heavy, I feel slow, I feel
lifeless.

## Running by numbers

[calculator](https://runalyze.com/tools/effective-vo2max?vo2max=60.00&units=km&paces=2)

There are a few numbers that I keep track of
- distance
- time
- average pace
- stride length and frequency
- average heart rate
- recovery heart rate
- resting heart rate
- weight
- hours of sleep
- blood pressure

Why do any of these matter? What is the fascination with measuring
everything? I think it's because it gives me a sense of control. I can see how I'm improving, how I'm getting fitter, how I'm getting
stronger. I can see the progress I'm making and that motivates me to
keep going. It's also a way of keeping track of my health. I can see
if I'm getting enough sleep, if my heart rate is too high, if my
blood pressure is too high. It's a way of being proactive about my
health and wellbeing.

Dealing with aging body is a challenge. I have to be careful not to
push myself too hard, not to overdo it. I have to listen to my body.
Once, a long time ago, I had a friend who was a great runner. He was
in his 60s and he could run a marathon in under 3 hours. He was an inspiration to me. But he pushed himself too hard and ended up with a heart attack on a beach run in Greece. I don't want that to happen to me. If you  want to keep running for as long as is reasonable, then you  have to be smart about it. My friend was lucky they fitted a pacemaker and he kept going for another 10 years. It feels like a defeat to me, a loss of control, surrendering to a little electronic device that governs your heart.
