# Viral Proteins

This is a very badly organised collection 
of correspondences from  [Bob
Penner](https://www.ihes.fr/en/professeur/robert-c-penner-2/).
This is an **early version** of the [current paper](virusforalexeii.pdf) which will be published shortly in the
Jounal of Computational Biology. The galley proofs are somewhere in my mail.


Bob has written down what he thinks the 
problem is in this [document](problem.pdf)

I've uploaded a the data from [6vsb](https://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/6VSB) which
What we are interested in is finding unusual features in the protein chains
which might be good targets for a synthetic vaccine. Bob has a scheme based on
chain. Look in the article - at least the introduction.

If you want to look at some of the raw data 
it's [here](6vsb/6vsb_merged_stress_density_full_graph.csv)
