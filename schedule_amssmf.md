# Special session 26
## Combinatorial and Computational Aspects of Topology

**IMPORTANT** the public transport network in Grenoble (TAG)
is usually very good however there is a lot of maintenance taking place 
and so you should check [on this page](https://www.tag.fr/1-accueil.htm?infoTrafic=1)
before travelling.

- the tram B and C come to campus
- you may have to change from the tram C to the tram B because of maintenance.

## Schedule

This is the schedule as of 7/7/22

- plenary talks are in the [Amphi Weil](https://goo.gl/maps/bfMkuKjfKBCJbRsX9)
- special session talks are in [Batiment F / UFR IM2AG / Salle 319](https://goo.gl/maps/VXct7MyxM1YVMciz8) about 5 minutes walk away
- welcome party Monday evening
- reception Tuesday evening
- banquet Thursday evening
