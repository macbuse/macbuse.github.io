# M1 Analyse fonctionelle

This page is a repo for exchanges 
in the TD group TD-1. It will be updated regularly
often more than once a day. It is convenient for
me because it looks good on my phone so I can  check things.


I'm sorry 
this is in english but I'm not having  my french keyboard.

## Practical points

1. We have a Discord server where we will meet.
1. We will try to have a video chat on Zoom sometimes so I can see you.
1. I might use a [virtual whiteboard](https://awwapp.com/#)
for teaching (so I can see your work)
so you should try it out and tell me if you can use it.
1. There will be corrections on YouTube but you **must** participate in class
   as much as possible by submitting scans of work and chatting.
1. I will usually post on this page the exercises with hints a day or two before class meets. 
1. Because classes are online we will only use class time to
  - discuss corrections you have prepared
  - discuss things that have been difficult to understand in the Friday lecture (cours magistral).
1. There may be a possibility to meet *en presentiel* in small groups but this
and we will organize this if possible **so check you are on the list of
names**.
1. Classes will be in french.

## Diverse references


When I teach I read a lot of things related to the material
you can see what I'm reading here... 

Sometimes 

- it's because I have forgotten the definitions/theorems
- it's because I am looking for the most elegant approach
