### Scenario One: A variant that causes severe disease in a greater proportion of the population than has occurred to date. 

For example, with similar morbidity/mortality to other zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (~10% case fatality) or MERS-CoV (~35% case fatality). This could be caused by:
1. Point mutations or recombination with other host or viral genes. This might
   occur through a change in SARS-CoV-2 internal genes such as the polymerase
   proteins or accessory proteins. These genes determine the outcome of
   infection by affecting the way the virus is sensed by the cell, the speed
   at which the virus replicates and the anti-viral response of the cell to
   infection. There is precedent for Coronaviruses (CoVs) to acquire
   additional genes or sequences from the host, from themselves or from other
   viruses.
2. By recombination between two VOC or VUIs. One with high drift (change in the
   spike glycoprotein) from the current spike glycoprotein gene used in the
   vaccine and the other with a more efficient replication and transmission
   determined by internal genes, for example, a recombination between beta and
   alpha or delta variants respectively. Alternatively, recombination may
   occur between two different variants with two different strategies for
   overcoming innate immunity, combining to give an additive or synergistic
   change of phenotype resulting in higher replication of the virus – and
   potentially increased morbidity and mortality. 

- Likelihood of genotypic change in internal genes: Likely whilst the circulation of SARSCoV-2 is high. 
- Likelihood of increased severity phenotype: Realistic possibility.


### Scenario Two: A variant that evades current vaccines. 
This could be caused by:
3. Antigenic ‘shift’: Natural recombination events that insert a different
   spike gene sequence (or partial sequence) from human CoVs MERS-CoV (highly
   unlikely due to the low frequency of MERS-CoV infections), or from
   currently circulating endemic human CoVs (more likely due to the prevalence
   of these viruses). This would recombine into the ‘body’ of SARS-CoV-2 that
   is capable of high replication in human cells. The consequence could be
   a virus that causes disease at a level similar to COVID-19 when it first
   emerged but against which our current battery of spike glycoprotein-based
   vaccines would not work. 
- Likelihood: Realistic possibility


### Scenario Three: Emergence of a drug resistant variant after anti-viral strategies. 

This could be caused by:

6. Emergence of new variants following the administration of directly acting
   antiviral therapies. As we begin to use directly acting antiviral drugs it
   is highly likely a variant will be selected that had resistance to
   individual agents. For example, drugs that target the viral 3C protease,
   drugs that target the polymerase, monoclonal antibodies that target the
   spike glycoprotein. If the drugs are used as a mono therapy, then resistant
   variants have a high probability of emerging. This may render all drugs in
  that category unusable. 

- Likelihood: Likely - unless the drugs are used correctly. 
- Impact: medium unless a scenario arises where drugs are needed more widely.


### Scenario Four: SARS-CoV-2 follows an evolutionary trajectory with decreased virulence. 

This could be caused by:
7. Variants arising with increased transmissibility but decreased
   pathogenesis/virulence as the virus becomes fully adapted to the human host
   becoming an endemic infection. Coupled with the likelihood of eventual high
   populations immunity the infection produces less disease. In other words,
   this virus will become like other human CoV that causes common colds, but
   with much less severe disease predominantly in the old or clinically
   vulnerable. 
- Likelihood: Unlikely in the short term, realistic possibility in the long term
