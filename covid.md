### Background: 
COVID-19 is responsible for increasing deaths globally. As most people dying with COVID-19 are older with underlying long-term conditions (LTCs), some speculate that YLL are low. We aim to estimate YLL attributable to COVID-19, before and after adjustment for number/type of LTCs, using the limited data available early in the pandemic.
Methods: We first estimated YLL from COVID-19 using WHO life tables, based on published age/sex data from COVID-19 deaths in Italy. We then used aggregate data on number/type of LTCs in a Bayesian model to estimate likely combinations of LTCs among people dying with COVID-19. We used routine UK healthcare data from Scotland and Wales to estimate life expectancy based on age/sex/these combinations of LTCs using Gompertz models from which we then estimate YLL.

### Results:
Using the standard WHO life tables, YLL per COVID-19 death was 14 for men and 12 for women. After adjustment for number and type of LTCs, the mean YLL was slightly lower, but remained high (11.6 and 9.4 years for men and women, respectively). The number and type of LTCs led to wide variability in the estimated YLL at a given age (e.g. at ≥80 years, YLL was >10 years for people with 0 LTCs, and less than 3 years for people with ≥6).

### Conclusions:
Deaths from COVID-19 represent a substantial burden in terms of per-person YLL, more than a decade, even after adjusting for the typical number and type of LTCs found in people dying of COVID-19. The extent of multimorbidity heavily influences the estimated YLL at a given age. More comprehensive and standardised collection of data (including LTC type, severity, and potential confounders such as socioeconomic-deprivation and care-home status) is needed to optimise YLL estimates for specific populations, and to understand the global burden of COVID-19, and guide policy-making and interventions.

### Scenario One: A variant that causes severe disease in a greater proportion of the population than has occurred to date. 

For example, with similar morbidity/mortality to other zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (~10% case fatality) or MERS-CoV (~35% case fatality). This could be caused by:
1. Point mutations or recombination with other host or viral genes. This might
   occur through a change in SARS-CoV-2 internal genes such as the polymerase
   proteins or accessory proteins. These genes determine the outcome of
   infection by affecting the way the virus is sensed by the cell, the speed
   at which the virus replicates and the anti-viral response of the cell to
   infection. There is precedent for Coronaviruses (CoVs) to acquire
   additional genes or sequences from the host, from themselves or from other
   viruses.
2. By recombination between two VOC or VUIs. One with high drift (change in the
   spike glycoprotein) from the current spike glycoprotein gene used in the
   vaccine and the other with a more efficient replication and transmission
   determined by internal genes, for example, a recombination between beta and
   alpha or delta variants respectively. Alternatively, recombination may
   occur between two different variants with two different strategies for
   overcoming innate immunity, combining to give an additive or synergistic
   change of phenotype resulting in higher replication of the virus – and
   potentially increased morbidity and mortality. 

- Likelihood of genotypic change in internal genes: Likely whilst the circulation of SARSCoV-2 is high. 
- Likelihood of increased severity phenotype: Realistic possibility.


### Scenario Two: A variant that evades current vaccines. 
This could be caused by:
3. Antigenic ‘shift’: Natural recombination events that insert a different
   spike gene sequence (or partial sequence) from human CoVs MERS-CoV (highly
   unlikely due to the low frequency of MERS-CoV infections), or from
   currently circulating endemic human CoVs (more likely due to the prevalence
   of these viruses). This would recombine into the ‘body’ of SARS-CoV-2 that
   is capable of high replication in human cells. The consequence could be
   a virus that causes disease at a level similar to COVID-19 when it first
   emerged but against which our current battery of spike glycoprotein-based
   vaccines would not work. 
- Likelihood: Realistic possibility


### Scenario Three: Emergence of a drug resistant variant after anti-viral strategies. 

This could be caused by:

6. Emergence of new variants following the administration of directly acting
   antiviral therapies. As we begin to use directly acting antiviral drugs it
   is highly likely a variant will be selected that had resistance to
   individual agents. For example, drugs that target the viral 3C protease,
   drugs that target the polymerase, monoclonal antibodies that target the
   spike glycoprotein. If the drugs are used as a mono therapy, then resistant
   variants have a high probability of emerging. This may render all drugs in
  that category unusable. 

- Likelihood: Likely - unless the drugs are used correctly. 
- Impact: medium unless a scenario arises where drugs are needed more widely.


### Scenario Four: SARS-CoV-2 follows an evolutionary trajectory with decreased virulence. 

This could be caused by:
7. Variants arising with increased transmissibility but decreased
   pathogenesis/virulence as the virus becomes fully adapted to the human host
   becoming an endemic infection. Coupled with the likelihood of eventual high
   populations immunity the infection produces less disease. In other words,
   this virus will become like other human CoV that causes common colds, but
   with much less severe disease predominantly in the old or clinically
   vulnerable. 
- Likelihood: Unlikely in the short term, realistic possibility in the long term

## Vaccinated vs unvaccinated

### British study: Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission

[webpage](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research-and-impact/groups/react-study/)

The published [REACT study](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/90800) looks at several metrics in un/vaccinated populations.

- prevalence of infections
- Ct thresholds 

Complicated because vaccination at the time of the study correlated strongly
with age.

- vaccine effectiveness [formula](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html)
- viral load, estimated using number of Ct cycles to threshold.
- doubling times

### Health:
People should get vaccinated because the evidence clearly indicates greater resistance to serious illness after infection.

### Public Policy:
Because the CDC has determined infected individuals shed the same amount of virus whether vaccinated or not, and because the CDC's study in Massachusetts indicated the vaccinated are potentially as likely to contract the virus as the unvaccinated*, and because there is no real effort to measure how readily the vaccinated contract and transmit the disease (article above - CDC stopped seeking data on contraction rate among the vaccinated in May), there is no basis for passports or employment restrictions on the unvaccinated -- they appear to be no more of a threat to others than the vaccinated, even if a greater threat to themselves.

*Some here point out that the unvaccinated are found to be much more prevelant among those tested after coming in for hospitalization; that is relevant to the 1st bullet above only because we'd expect the vaccinated who catch (and can pass) the virus not to come into the hospital (vaccines prevent serious illness). In other words, those findings have no bearing on determining whether the vaccinated are catching and passing it.

Finally, Ct values obtained with SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide a crude correlation to the amount of virus present in a sample and can also be affected by factors other than viral load.††† Although the assay used in this investigation was not validated to provide quantitative results, there was no significant difference between the Ct values of samples collected from breakthrough cases and the other cases. This might mean that the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also similar. However, microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings.

"if vaccinated people get infected anyway, they have as much virus in their bodies as unvaccinated people. That means they’re as likely to infect someone else as unvaccinated people who get infected."
