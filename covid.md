### Press

There is an interesting analysis of how media coverage is 
[partisan](https://mediacloud.org/news/2021/4/3/coverage-of-covid-19-and-political-partisanship-comparing-across-nations) based on [prior work](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/28351)

Central to the practice of objectivity as truth seeking is not infallibility but
institutionalized error detection and correction. This is as true for journalism
as it is for the scientific method, though the speed of publication, sensitivity
to markets, and levels of evidence necessary in each enterprise differ
significantly and result in different institutional details. And for all the
differences between them, the projects of journalism and science are both
committed to norms of truth seeking anchored in a reality that is prior to and
external to opinion and perspective. It is fundamentally different from the
project of denying the possibility of truth beyond partisan perspective.

Covid: What’s the best way to top up our immunity?
[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58270098)

```"We could be digging ourselves into a hole, for a very long time, where we think we can only keep Covid away by boosting every year," Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist from the University of Edinburgh
```

[Riley Roslin Institut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Riley)

```"This isn't proven, but it could be a lot cheaper and simpler to let that happen than spend the whole time immunising people," said Prof Finn, who warns we could end up "locked into a cycle of boosting" without seeing if it was necessary. he said the argument in children had "already been won" as "40-50% have already been infected and most weren't ill or particularly ill".

## LWA: 

[gupta interview: Covid-19 culture war](https://www.newframe.com/sunetra-gupta-and-the-covid-19-culture-war/)

```The result is a weirdly counterintuitive political battlefield, in which a large segment of the Left is calling for authoritarian measures that will further impoverish the already destitute, while a large segment of the Right is calling for anti-authoritarian measures that will help the impoverished. It’s the ideological equivalent of one of Maurits Cornelis Escher’s illogical waterfalls: up is down, and down is up. But despite the wild allegations of malevolent conspiracies on both sides, it is clear that the serious researchers are thinking and acting in good faith. Both sides are simply prioritising one dimension of the unfolding tragedy.
```

and

``` For Balloux, what is unfolding is a societal calamity in the wake of a public health calamity. “What I really regret, deeply, is that in most places we have failed to have a real discussion,” he says. “In the early days, there wasn’t much time to decide on the early mitigation measures. But then instead of moving toward a more helpful dialogue, we degenerated into slogans and into polarisation, which is extremely unhelpful.  “Covid-19 will not just be remembered as a health crisis, but as a major moral, psychological and geopolitical crisis.”
```

It is disturbing to hear *liberals* promoting authoritarian policies (lockdowns, compulsory vaccination etc.) but there seems to be some literature on this:

[free speech](https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share#liberals-are-divided-political-expression)

In fact, in our work, liberals are just as likely as conservatives to agree with statements endorsing that 
- some groups should “just shut up and accept their group’s proper place in society.” 
- Similarly, there are as many liberals as conservatives who want to “put some tough leaders in power” to “silence the troublemakers,” 

    and these liberal authoritarians are just as likely as conservative authoritarians to want a mighty leader who will “destroy,” “smash,” “crush,” “strongly punish,” and “silence” opponents. 

Polling suggests that 50 percent of Democrats want Trump donors, and actresses, baseball personalities, and Google employees who have expressed conservative views fired.

 Altemeyer’s (1981) reconceptualization of authoritarianism as RWA—the covariation of 
 - authoritarian submission (i.e., obsequiousness to established authority),
 - authoritarian aggression (i.e., aggression towards outgroup members),
 -  conventionalism (i.e., strict adherence to socially conservative norms)
 
 —reinvigorated the literature while circumventing questions of political
 specificity by explicitly integrating political conservatism, rendering RWA the
 dominant psychological account of authoritarianism.

### Terror management 

[Terror Management Theory and the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498956/pdf/10.1177_0022167820959488.pdf)

Terror management theory is focused on the role that awareness of death plays in diverse aspects of life. Here, we discuss the theory’s implications for understanding the widely varying ways in which people have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We argue that regardless of whether one consciously believes that the virus is 
- a major threat to life or only 
- a minor inconvenience, 

fear of death plays an important role in driving one’s attitudes and behavior related to the virus. 
We focus on the terror management theory distinction between 
- proximal defenses, which are activated when thoughts of death are in current focal attention and are logically related to the threat at hand, 
- distal defenses, which are activated when thoughts of death are on the fringes of one’s consciousness and entail the pursuit of meaning, personal value, and close relationships. 

We use this framework to discuss the many ways in which COVID-19 undermines psychological equanimity, the diverse ways people have responded to this threat, and the role of ineffective terror management in psychological distress and disorder that may emerge in response to the virus.

[Coping with ‘Death Awareness’ in the COVID-19 Era](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coping-with-death-awareness-in-the-covid-19-era/) According to terror management theory, people can have surprising reactions.

In a series of studies entitled “The Scrooge Effect,” researcher Eva Jonas, then at Ludwig Maximilian University in Germany, and her colleagues found that people were more favorable toward charities—for instance, they thought a given charity was more beneficial to society—when they were interviewed in front of a funeral home than they were just a few blocks away. And when American participants were given a chance to donate money to an American charity, those assigned to write about their own death gave about 400 percent more than did those who instead had been asked to write about dental pain.

Interestingly, however, participants in the same study did not give higher donations to a foreign charity, because that would benefit people different from them. As this finding suggests, when death salience is high, as it is now with COVID-19, we can go either way: we might become motivated to make a positive difference, but we can also become more susceptible to the trap of racism and other forms of out-group bias.

## Years of life lost

- [article comorbidities vs yll](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-75)
- [Github repo ](https://github.com/dmcalli2/covid19_yll_final)
- [blog comorbidbities vs yll](https://avalonecon.com/moving-beyond-lives-saved-from-covid-19/)

### Background: 
COVID-19 is responsible for increasing deaths globally. As most people dying with COVID-19 are older with underlying long-term conditions (LTCs), some speculate that YLL are low. We aim to estimate YLL attributable to COVID-19, before and after adjustment for number/type of LTCs, using the limited data available early in the pandemic.
Methods: We first estimated YLL from COVID-19 using WHO life tables, based on published age/sex data from COVID-19 deaths in Italy. We then used aggregate data on number/type of LTCs in a Bayesian model to estimate likely combinations of LTCs among people dying with COVID-19. We used routine UK healthcare data from Scotland and Wales to estimate life expectancy based on age/sex/these combinations of LTCs using Gompertz models from which we then estimate YLL.

### Results:
Using the standard WHO life tables, YLL per COVID-19 death was 14 for men and 12 for women. After adjustment for number and type of LTCs, the mean YLL was slightly lower, but remained high (11.6 and 9.4 years for men and women, respectively). The number and type of LTCs led to wide variability in the estimated YLL at a given age (e.g. at ≥80 years, YLL was >10 years for people with 0 LTCs, and less than 3 years for people with ≥6).

### Conclusions:
Deaths from COVID-19 represent a substantial burden in terms of per-person YLL, more than a decade, even after adjusting for the typical number and type of LTCs found in people dying of COVID-19. The extent of multimorbidity heavily influences the estimated YLL at a given age. More comprehensive and standardised collection of data (including LTC type, severity, and potential confounders such as socioeconomic-deprivation and care-home status) is needed to optimise YLL estimates for specific populations, and to understand the global burden of COVID-19, and guide policy-making and interventions.

- A variant that evades current vaccines. 
- Emergence of a drug resistant variant after anti-viral strategies. 
- SARS-CoV-2 follows an evolutionary trajectory with decreased virulence. 

---


### Scenario One: A variant that causes severe disease in a greater proportion of the population than has occurred to date. 

For example, with similar morbidity/mortality to other zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (~10% case fatality) or MERS-CoV (~35% case fatality). This could be caused by:
1. Point mutations or recombination with other host or viral genes. This might
   occur through a change in SARS-CoV-2 internal genes such as the polymerase
   proteins or accessory proteins. These genes determine the outcome of
   infection by affecting the way the virus is sensed by the cell, the speed
   at which the virus replicates and the anti-viral response of the cell to
   infection. There is precedent for Coronaviruses (CoVs) to acquire
   additional genes or sequences from the host, from themselves or from other
   viruses.
2. By recombination between two VOC or VUIs. One with high drift (change in the
   spike glycoprotein) from the current spike glycoprotein gene used in the
   vaccine and the other with a more efficient replication and transmission
   determined by internal genes, for example, a recombination between beta and
   alpha or delta variants respectively. Alternatively, recombination may
   occur between two different variants with two different strategies for
   overcoming innate immunity, combining to give an additive or synergistic
   change of phenotype resulting in higher replication of the virus – and
   potentially increased morbidity and mortality. 

- Likelihood of genotypic change in internal genes: Likely whilst the circulation of SARSCoV-2 is high. 
- Likelihood of increased severity phenotype: Realistic possibility.


### Scenario Two: A variant that evades current vaccines. 
This could be caused by:
3. Antigenic ‘shift’: Natural recombination events that insert a different
   spike gene sequence (or partial sequence) from human CoVs MERS-CoV (highly
   unlikely due to the low frequency of MERS-CoV infections), or from
   currently circulating endemic human CoVs (more likely due to the prevalence
   of these viruses). This would recombine into the ‘body’ of SARS-CoV-2 that
   is capable of high replication in human cells. The consequence could be
   a virus that causes disease at a level similar to COVID-19 when it first
   emerged but against which our current battery of spike glycoprotein-based
   vaccines would not work. 
- Likelihood: Realistic possibility


### Scenario Three: Emergence of a drug resistant variant after anti-viral strategies. 

This could be caused by:

6. Emergence of new variants following the administration of directly acting
   antiviral therapies. As we begin to use directly acting antiviral drugs it
   is highly likely a variant will be selected that had resistance to
   individual agents. For example, drugs that target the viral 3C protease,
   drugs that target the polymerase, monoclonal antibodies that target the
   spike glycoprotein. If the drugs are used as a mono therapy, then resistant
   variants have a high probability of emerging. This may render all drugs in
  that category unusable. 

- Likelihood: Likely - unless the drugs are used correctly. 
- Impact: medium unless a scenario arises where drugs are needed more widely.


### Scenario Four: SARS-CoV-2 follows an evolutionary trajectory with decreased virulence. 

This could be caused by:
7. Variants arising with increased transmissibility but decreased
   pathogenesis/virulence as the virus becomes fully adapted to the human host
   becoming an endemic infection. Coupled with the likelihood of eventual high
   populations immunity the infection produces less disease. In other words,
   this virus will become like other human CoV that causes common colds, but
   with much less severe disease predominantly in the old or clinically
   vulnerable. 
- Likelihood: Unlikely in the short term, realistic possibility in the long term

## Vaccinated vs unvaccinated

### Purpose of vaccination

[Study](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/231557/covid-vaccines-effective-household-transmission-delta/)

``` These are the findings of a study of COVID-19 transmission between household contacts, led by Imperial College London and the UK Health Security Agency (HSA) and published today in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.
```

[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/10/mandatory-covid-jabs-nhs-staff-frontline-workers-unvaccinated-pandemic#comment-153028654)

```Frontline workers cannot expect to remain unvaccinated in a pandemic and to keep working with vulnerable people
```


It finds that people who have received two doses of vaccine have a lower, but still appreciable, risk of becoming infected with the delta variant in the home compared with people who are unvaccinated. The authors stress that vaccination also reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalisation and death from COVID-19.

### REACT

#### British study: Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission

[webpage](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research-and-impact/groups/react-study/)

The published [REACT study](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/90800) looks at several metrics in un/vaccinated populations.

- prevalence of infections
- Ct thresholds 

Complicated because vaccination at the time of the study correlated strongly with age.

- vaccine effectiveness [formula](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html)
- viral load, estimated using number of Ct cycles to threshold.
- doubling times
-

#### Ct threshold values

So the REACT values: For all positives in round 13, at ages 18 to 64 years, median Ct value was higher for vaccinated participants at
- vaccinated participants at 27.6 (25.5, 29.7) compared with 
- unvaccinated at 23.1 (20.3, 25.8) 
- (positive defined as N gene Ct less than 37 or both N gene and E gene positive, 

Based on this and the guidelines below  the viral load is 10**(1.5) ~ 30 times higher.  I find this a little hard to believe given the CDC Massachusetts study.


[Paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/64683) Ct threshold values, a proxy
for viral load in community SARS-CoV-2 cases, demonstrate wide variation across populations and over time.

[UK gov PCR guide](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf)

A typical RT-PCR assay will have a maximum of 40 thermal cycles. The lower the Ct value the higher the quantity of viral genetic material in the sample (as an approximate proxy for viral load). Ct values obtained in this way are semi-quantitative and are able to distinguish between high and low viral load. A 3-point increase in Ct value is roughly equivalent to a 10-fold decrease in the quantity of viral genetic material.  

In some circumstances, Ct values can be used as a more quantitative technique to accurately measure the number of viral copies per cell in the original sample – however, this requires that the sample is tested alongside verified standard dilutions and there is fixed sample input alongside quantification of cellular content of a swab sample(1,2).  Most diagnostic laboratories do not routinely perform this quantification for respiratory
viral swabs – quantitative PCR is more common in measuring blood-borne viral load.

## CDC Massachusetts


[src](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/06/cdc-covid-coronavirus-data-breakthrough-cases#comment-151140644)

### Health:
People should get vaccinated because the evidence clearly indicates greater resistance to serious illness after infection.

### Public Policy:
Because the CDC has determined infected individuals shed the same amount of virus whether vaccinated or not, and because the CDC's study in Massachusetts indicated the vaccinated are potentially as likely to contract the virus as the unvaccinated*, and because there is no real effort to measure how readily the vaccinated contract and transmit the disease (article above - CDC stopped seeking data on contraction rate among the vaccinated in May), there is no basis for passports or employment restrictions on the unvaccinated -- they appear to be no more of a threat to others than the vaccinated, even if a greater threat to themselves.

*Some here point out that the unvaccinated are found to be much more prevelant among those tested after coming in for hospitalization; that is relevant to the 1st bullet above only because we'd expect the vaccinated who catch (and can pass) the virus not to come into the hospital (vaccines prevent serious illness). In other words, those findings have no bearing on determining whether the vaccinated are catching and passing it.

---

[Primary](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm)
Finally, Ct values obtained with SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide a crude correlation to the amount of virus present in a sample and can also be affected by factors other than viral load.††† Although the assay used in this investigation was not validated to provide quantitative results, there was no significant difference between the Ct values of samples collected from breakthrough cases and the other cases. This might mean that the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also similar. However, microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings.

### The elephant named “waning immunity”

Since late last year, we’ve heard that Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines are “95% effective” with even greater efficacy against severe disease (“100% effective,” Moderna said).

Whatever one thinks about the “95% effective” claims (my thoughts are here), even the most enthusiastic commentators have acknowledged that measuring vaccine efficacy two months after dosing says little about just how long vaccine-induced immunity will last. “We’re going to be looking very intently at the durability of protection,” Pfizer senior vice president William Gruber, an author on the recent preprint, told the FDA’s advisory committee last December.


[CNN : 39% effective](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/delta-variant-pfizer-covid-vaccine-39percent-effective-in-israel-prevents-severe-illness.html)

Waning efficacy has the potential to be far more than a minor inconvenience; it can dramatically change the risk-benefit calculus. And whatever its cause—intrinsic properties of the vaccine, the circulation of new variants, some combination of the two, or something else—the bottom line is that vaccines need to be effective.

Until new clinical trials demonstrate that boosters increase efficacy above 50%, without increasing serious adverse events, it is unclear whether the 2-dose series would even meet the FDA’s approval standard at six or nine months.

[Phase III trials limited](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4037)

But here we are, with FDA reportedly on the verge of granting a marketing license 13 months into the still ongoing, two year pivotal trial, with no reported data past 13 March 2021, unclear efficacy after six months due to unblinding, evidence of waning protection irrespective of the Delta variant, and limited reporting of safety data. (The preprint reports “decreased appetite, lethargy, asthenia, malaise, night sweats, and hyperhidrosis were new adverse events attributable to BNT162b2 not previously identified in earlier reports,” but provides no data tables showing the frequency of these, or other, adverse events.)

[Petition against approval](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/06/08/why-we-petitioned-the-fda-to-refrain-from-fully-approving-any-covid-19-vaccine-this-year/)

Trials by vaccine manufacturers were designed to follow participants for two years, and should be completed before they are evaluated for full approval, even if they are now unblinded and lack placebo groups. These Phase III trials are not simply efficacy studies; they also are necessary and important safety studies (as the study titles say), and all collected data remain invaluable.

We also call on FDA to require a more thorough assessment of spike proteins produced in-situ by the body following vaccination—including studies on their 
- full biodistribution, 
- pharmacokinetics, 
- tissue-specific toxicities. 
-
We ask the FDA
- to demand manufacturers complete proper biodistribution studies that would be expected of any new drug 
- request additional studies to better understand the implications of mRNA translation in distant tissues. 

We call on data demonstrating a thorough investigation of all serious adverse events reported to pharmacovigilance systems, carried out by independent, impartial individuals, and for safety data from individuals receiving more than two vaccine doses, in consideration of plans for future booster shots. 

We ask the FDA to request necessary studies in specific populations,
- previously infected with SARS-CoV-2,
- pediatric subjects,
- and those with immunological or other underlying medical complexities. 

Given the nature of the novel vaccine platforms, our petition asks for experts in gene therapy to be included among the external committee advising the FDA.
