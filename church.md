##### Why ?

Well I have to maintain a ton of files because of offline teaching 
- migrating to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for (fast/managed) synch
- using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)  for readability and cross format conversion via [pandoc]()
- integrating tool like fuzzy finders [fzf]() to minimize cognitive overload


so from my point of view this
( and frankly I really really don't care what you think because I started out writing
programs with punch cards then
[ed](https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/) )

- seemed the logical way to go.
- I couldn't bear to use **VScode**.
- I'm a big fan of [tmux](https://www.howtogeek.com/671422/how-to-use-tmux-on-linux-and-why-its-better-than-screen/) and [i3](https://i3wm.org/) but it's really really just for geeks
