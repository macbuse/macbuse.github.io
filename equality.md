progress has stalled not because of specific barriers against women but because the wider issues have been unresolved. 
When it comes to equality the biggest barriers is lack of accountability and lack of truly being blind to someone's background when deciding positions of skill or otherwise.
Now, while it is true that by far men are the bigger proportion of transgressors even beyond the ratio in positions of power, it is not BECAUSE they are men that the problem arises.
So my small tech start-up I worked for illegally fired all of its women and ethnic minorities on the same day but it also did the same thing to several white men and the reason had nothing to do with gender or race but to do with power and greed. And no there was no accountability available.
Also where I had tried to help a vulnerable woman, I was equally block from progress by institutions run by women, Priti Patel, Cressida Dick and a head of local social services.
You mention accolades for progress naming women who have furthered their own cause but could not find one man's name to add to the list.
If you seek to redress balance by saying that an under represented group needs to suddenly fill the majority of senior positions at the same time you make it harder for people with skills in majority groups to break through very different ceilings.
The final point to make is that international women's day was set up as a communist ideal and not necessarily aligned with Western democratic ideals which is why it is a holiday in China but barely mentioned here.
The solution is to address needs, don't simply look at where there are imbalances and make sure that when people are reported such as #metoo or Boris Johnson's partygate that people are held to account rather depending on people choosing to resign.
And Labour is a long way from addressing many core issues and Theresa May and Margaret Thatcher are hardly beacons for what was done for women.

Middle class women in Britain-and white middle class women in particular-are one of the most privileged groups in this country.For whilst they don't control the levers of power they have influence with the men who do.And they have choices that generally aren't open to their menfolk.For instance the most affluent family areas in this country contain a relatively high percentage of working-aged women who don't work.
Indeed the ongoing debate about whether mothers should work is only relevant to middle class mothers who have a high earning partner.Because for working class women and for lone mothers not working is likely to drive their families into poverty.And even when they do work they can still live in poverty for in-work poverty poverty disproportionately hits lone mothers and working class women.And working class black and asian women are hit hardest of all.
It may not be a popular thing to say here but i think middle class women and white middle class women need to check their privilege from time to time.For they have been the main beneficiaries of feminism and some might argue that rather wanting equality with their equally privileged menfolk what they really want is the best of both worlds as and when it suits them.

Because many attitudes lie in the subconscious mind of humans, both male and female. Especially Business rewards ruthless behaviour. The message has long been not to be kind to each other but to beat each other. If you can't beat them, join them. A lot of successful business women had to take on somewhat male attributes to succeed and made life harder for many women at the lower end of the career ladder. Rather than teaching society that treating each other fairly will be a win win for all it was just about gaining the same rights. Instead of teaching men to be better people they taught them to be scared of saying the wrong thing. Because capitalism thrives on selfish behaviour. Humans are doomed. There I said it (Woman here...)

Progress for women has stalled because while women rose to the occasion, educated themselves, got careers, evolved, men didn't evolve alongside them or step up to join them.
The result is women didn't suddenly find themselves enjoying a much better position, but instead found themselves having to occupy two positions at once. Men, undoubtedly, will have faced their own existential crisis in response to this.
Alongside this, women have been undermined by two bedfellows: consumerism-driven social media applying pressure on how women look and behave; and male-led woke campaigns, the aim of which is to dissolve spaces where women can feel safe and valued.

With all these types of articles/discussions it is always the people in the middle who get forgotten. Women who have really good careers or women at the bottom. It is always the ones in the middle who get forgotten or punished. For instance the NI rise will really hit my daughter who hasn’t had a pay rise for two years and would love to have a baby which she’s sadly cannot afford. It is no wonder we have a falling birth rate. People like Rachel Reeves also never considers that some women would actually like to stay at home and look after their children but this isn’t an option unless you are on benefits or marry a really rich man.

I think your points are true in the context of the legal profession, which I have some contact with through relatives. But law is such a dinosaur environment. Even their use of technology, even standard office software, is 20 years behind everyone else. And it has a disproportionate share of entitled men who went to boys schools. In a lot of other sectors, my own included, things are far better. In my sector, which is highly technical, there is genuinely no equality problem. All that matters is that you're good at the job. I disagree that the UK is one of the worst, France and southern Europe are considerably more sexist.
