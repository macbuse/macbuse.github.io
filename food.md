## Lentil curry

I found this recipe
[here](https://www.theedgyveg.com/2018/01/08/instant-pot-dal-indian-dal-recipe/)


- 2 Tbsp coconut oil
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp minced ginger
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- ¼ tsp cayenne
- ¼ tsp mustard seeds
- 1½ cups of dried brown or red lentils
- 3 cups water
- ½ tsp salt
- 2 tomatoes, chopped
- ¼ cup fresh cilantro, chopped + extra for garnish


This wasn't creamy enough so I replaced some of the water with coconut milk.
I actually managet to burn the lentils - they stuck to the bottom of tthe bowl:
( maybe use moooore water or scrape the bowl with a wooden spatula to get it
clean before pressure cooking......................

Usual curry prep then:
* pressure cooking time 10 minutes.
* wait 10 mins before opening the pressure valve.


## Celery soup

I read this
[here](https://www.curryandvanilla.com/celery-soup-with-cumin-and-ginger-pressure-cooker-method/)

Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 teaspoon oil
- ½ tsp cumin seeds/jeera
- 1-inch piece ginger, chopped into large pieces
- 2 to 3 green chillies/jalapenos, slit
- ½ cup green onions (white portion), chopped
- 2 cups chopped celery
- Salt to taste
- Black Pepper powder
- Celery leaves and chopped green onions for garnishing

To make it creamier I added coconut milk as usual.

Usual curry prep then 

- Add celery and cook, stirring, until just starting to soften, about 3 minutes.
- Stir in 1 cup of water, close the pressure cooker and cook on high for 4 or 5 minutes. Once the pressure has dropped, strain the mixture into a saucepan.

I pureed it and didn't do this :

- Remove the slit green chilies and pieces of ginger and blend the rest to a fine puree.
- Transfer the pureed onion-celery mixture to the strained celery broth, add 2 cups of water, season with salt to taste and mix well. Add a pinch of sugar, if needed, to balance the flavors.
- Bring to a boil on high heat and then simmer on medium low for about 5 to 7 minutes.
