# Differential equations

#

$ y' = y, y(0)=1 $

!![M](Okay, we're gonna look at a very simple differential equation. 

It's one that you would see on the very first day
of a differential equations class but
we're gonna solve it five different ways.)

#

$ y' = y, y(0)=1$

!![K](This is one of my favorite problems to put on
the final exam for a differential equations class.

We'll see that it's really  pretty easy!  
So it helps to build confidence.
But it does give the student an opportunity to
use  all the techniques that they've learned about during the semester.)

#

## Guess and check

$ y' = y, y(0)=1$

!![M](Our first method is going to be guess
and check.
So we have 
Y prime equals Y  and Y
of zero equals 1.

Now what I mean by
guess and  check is just think through the
catalog of functions that you know and
ask yourself the question:

what function has the
property that when you take their
derivative you get back to it again?)

#
## Guess and check

$ y(x) = e^x \Rightarrow y' = y$
!![M](It doesn't take  too long to see
that there's only one function like that.
It is Y equals E to the X of course. )

#
## Guess and check
$ y(x) = Ae^x \Rightarrow y' = y$
!![K](
Then you say to yourself:
Well I can multiply it  by a constant,
and I still get a solution to the equation!)

#
## Guess and check
$ y(0) = Ae^0 \Rightarrow 1  = A$

$ y(x) = e^x$
!![K](
But we've got an initial condition.
If I plug in X equals zero I should get
one, but that tells me that the constant is  one.
So then,  our solution is Y equals E to the X!
)

#
## Guess and check

$ y(x) = e^x$

!![M](
Now you might think that it's kind of cheesy to guess
and check a solution, but a lot of really
important mathematics on the cutting
edge happens by guessing and checking!
)

# Done

!![K](
Good!  We've finished our first method. That was easy, wasn't it?
