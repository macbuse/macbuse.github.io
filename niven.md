### Mordell

A quadratic form
$$Q = a x^2 + 2h xy + c y^2$$
is a sum of squares iff
- discriminant is a square
- all prime factors of the pgcd (a, h, c) are congruent to 1 mod 4

**Can this be proved by reduction?**

Every Gaussian integer is a sum of 2 squares

### Lagrange's four-square theorem


Every natural number is a sum of 4 squares


**Lemma (reduction)**:
If $m$ and $n$ are sums of 4 squares then so is $mn$

---
**Lemma**:

Let $p$ be a prime
the there are integers $x, y$ such that
$$x^2 + y^2 \equiv -1 \mod p$$
