To give three medals at once to representatives of the French mathematical school, and all three'of them noted for the art of manipulation of inequalities, is hardly a help to the international prestige of French mathematics 2- particularly coming at a time when the president of the International Mathematical Union (the organization naming the Fields Committee) was a well-known French analyst. It is hard to affirm a causal relation between these circumstances; that would imply a quite unlikely degree of corruption.
