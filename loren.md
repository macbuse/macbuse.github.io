# Billiards


If $\Delta$ is a hyperbolic triangle
with angles $\pi/p, \pi/q, \pi/r$,
and $1/p + 1/q + 1/r < 1$,
then the reflexions in the sides of $\Delta$
generate a group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane
isomorphic to the [triangle group
$\Delta(p,q,r)$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_group).

The reflexions are a canonical set of generators
and provided $p,q,r < \infty$ the Cayley graph of the group with respect to these generators
is quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic plane (this is [Svarc-Milnor
lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0varc%E2%80%93Milnor_lemma#Examples_of_applications_of_the_%C5%A0varc%E2%80%93Milnor_lemma)).

This means that the translation length $\ell(\gamma)$ of an element of the triangle
group and the distance in the Cayley graph $\| \gamma \|_W$ are comparable:

$$ c_1 \| \gamma\|_W \leq \ell(\gamma) \leq c_2 \| \gamma\|_W  $$

where $\| \gamma\|_W$ is the word length of $\gamma$ with respect to the canonical generators. This is basically just compacity of the fundamental domain of the triangle group.


Let $A$ be the covering space of $\mathbb{H}^2$ corresponding to the subgroup triangle group generated by $\gamma$.
It is easy to see that $A$ is an annulus, with  a single closed geodesic which is the lift of $\gamma$.

Now the word length can be computed by counting the
number of translates $g(\Delta) \subset A$ of the fundamental domain that the lift of $\gamma$ intersects. 
Let $D$ denote the diameter of $\Delta$ then each $g(\Delta)$ is contained in a regular neighborhood of
radius $D$ of  the lift of $\gamma$ to $A$.

Thus 
$$\|\gamma\|_W\cdot\mathrm{Area}(\Delta) = \mathrm {Area}(\cup g(\Delta)) \leq \mathrm{Area}(N(D))$$ 
where $N(D)$ is the regular neighborhood of radius $D$ of the lift of $\gamma$ to $A$.

The area of $N(D)$ is $\ell(\gamma) \cdot 2\sinh(D)$ (I think).

This is just an adaptation of the same argument in Euclidean
geometry. Below is a picture of a billiard path (red curve) in the standard square torus. The fundamental domains are the squares and the ones with a cross meet the billiard path. They are contained in the blue rectangle which is a lift of the regular neighborhood in the annulus (cylinder) covering space.

The sides of the rectangle have lengths

- $\ell(\gamma)$ 
- and $2D = 2\sqrt{2}$, ie twice the diameter of the square and
