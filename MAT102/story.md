## Lynna and the hot chocolate

Lynna was running late for her math class. She had overslept that morning and had to rush to get ready and out the door. As she ran through the school corridors, she could see the other students filing into their classrooms. She had to make it to her math class before the teacher started the lesson.

When she finally arrived at her math class, she was out of breath and her heart was racing. She slowly opened the door and peeked inside. The teacher was already at the front of the class, writing on the board. She had missed the beginning of the lesson.

Feeling embarrassed and ashamed, Lynna walked into the classroom and took her seat. The teacher stopped writing and turned to face her. "Ah, Lynna, I see you have finally arrived," he said. "I hope you have a good excuse for being late."

Lynna hung her head in shame. She didn't have a good excuse for being late. She had simply overslept and now she was paying the price. She looked up at the teacher and said, "I'm sorry, sir. I overslept this morning and I had to rush to get here. I'm really sorry."

The teacher sighed and looked at Lynna with a mixture of annoyance and sympathy. "Well, Lynna, I'm not going to hold it against you this time. But you need to be more responsible and make sure you're not late for class again. Understood?"

"Yes, sir," Lynna said, feeling relieved.

But the teacher wasn't done yet. "And as a gesture of goodwill, you can make it up to me by buying me a hot chocolate from the cafeteria. I could use one right now to wake me up."

Lynna's face lit up. She was happy to do something to make it up to the teacher. She quickly got up from her seat and ran to the cafeteria to buy the hot chocolate. When she returned to the classroom, the teacher gratefully accepted the hot chocolate and took a sip.

"Thank you, Lynna," he said with a smile. "That was very kind of you. And I must say, this hot chocolate is just what I needed. Now, let's get back to our lesson."

From that day on, Lynna made sure to be on time for her math class. She learned the importance of being responsible and making up for her mistakes. And she was grateful to her teacher for giving her a second chance and teaching her a valuable lesson.
