We are asked to find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the segment
\([PQ]\), where:
- \(P(1,3)\)
- \(Q(-1,2)\).

---

### Step 1: Midpoint of \([PQ]\)
The midpoint \(M\) has coordinates:
$$
M = \left(\frac{1 + (-1)}{2}, \frac{3 + 2}{2}\right) = (0, \tfrac{5}{2})
$$

---

### Step 2: Slope of \(PQ\)
The slope of the line \(PQ\) is:
$$
m_{PQ} = \frac{3 - 2}{1 - (-1)} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

---

### Step 3: Slope of the perpendicular bisector
The perpendicular slope is the negative reciprocal:
$$
m_{\perp} = -\frac{1}{m_{PQ}} = -2
$$

---

### Step 4: Equation of the perpendicular bisector
Equation through \(M(0,\tfrac{5}{2})\) with slope \(-2\):
$$
y - \frac{5}{2} = -2(x - 0)
$$
$$
y = -2x + \frac{5}{2}
$$

---

### âœ… Final Answer
The equation of the perpendicular bisector of \([PQ]\) is:
$$
\boxed{y = -2x + \tfrac{5}{2}}
$$
