In many countries there has been a shift to using graded coursework rather than exams to evaluate students in order to reduce exam stress. Now, with easy access to AI/LLMs, isn't this a dangerous/ obsolete strategy?


New Assessment Strategy,Focus/What it Measures
Oral Exams / Vivas,"Measures fluency, depth of understanding, and the ability to verbally defend and explain the reasoning behind the submitted work."
Process-Based Work,"Grading the intermediate steps (annotated drafts, recorded brainstorming sessions, version history, or a research log) rather than just the final product."
Authentic Assessment,"Assigning tasks that require real-world context, local data, physical creation, or on-site application that AI cannot easily replicate."
AI-Integrated Assessments,"Assignments that explicitly require the ethical use of AI (e.g., ""Use ChatGPT to draft a proposal, then critically analyze, correct, and justify the required changes""). This shifts the focus from production to critical editing and prompt engineering."

That is a powerful and critically important question currently being debated across educational institutions worldwide. The consensus is that the shift to unsupervised coursework, initially intended to reduce exam stress and promote deeper learning, has become **highly vulnerable and potentially obsolete** in the age of easily accessible Generative AI (like ChatGPT).

## ⚠️ The Danger: Undermining Academic Integrity

Generative AI poses a significant threat to the integrity of traditional coursework assessments:

* **Undetectable Cheating:** Numerous studies have shown that AI-generated submissions can go **largely undetected** by markers and, often, by AI detection software itself (which also carries a risk of false positives). In one study, 97% of AI-written undergraduate responses went undetected, and they scored higher than the real students' work.
* **Devaluation of Learning:** Coursework is meant to measure a student's ability to research, synthesize information, and develop critical arguments over time. When an LLM can produce a polished, high-scoring essay or complex report in seconds, the coursework no longer measures the student's *effort* or *learning*—it measures their ability to use AI as a black box.
* **The "Unfair Advantage":** Students who use AI to complete take-home assignments are gaining an unfair advantage, potentially leading to a widespread decline in the overall credibility of grades and degrees.

## 🔄 The Response: A Shift Back or a Shift Forward?

The educational establishment is currently exploring two main paths in response to this crisis:

### 1. The Defensive "Shift Back"

Some institutions and instructors are returning to traditional, supervised methods:

* **In-Person, Pen-and-Paper Exams:** This is the most straightforward way to guarantee students do not have access to AI tools. Many universities have reported a surge in the use of "blue books" (exam paper notebooks).
* **Closed-Book, Invigilated Assessments:** Conducting more exams under controlled conditions to ensure the work is genuinely the student's own.
* **In-Class Coursework:** Requiring significant portions of coursework (like drafting, research, or complex problem-solving) to be completed *during class time* under direct supervision to allow teachers to authenticate the work.

### 2. The Adaptive "Shift Forward" (Redefining Assessment)

This path seeks to move beyond the AI detection arms race by changing *what* is being assessed. This is seen by many as the only sustainable long-term solution.

| New Assessment Strategy | Focus/What it Measures |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Oral Exams / Vivas** | Measures fluency, depth of understanding, and the ability to verbally defend and explain the reasoning behind the submitted work. |
| **Process-Based Work** | Grading the *intermediate steps* (annotated drafts, recorded brainstorming sessions, version history, or a research log) rather than just the final product. |
| **Authentic Assessment** | Assigning tasks that require real-world context, local data, physical creation, or on-site application that AI cannot easily replicate. |
| **AI-Integrated Assessments** | Assignments that explicitly *require* the ethical use of AI (e.g., "Use ChatGPT to draft a proposal, then critically analyze, correct, and justify the required changes"). This shifts the focus from production to **critical editing and prompt engineering**. |

While the initial shift to coursework was driven by a commendable goal (reducing stress), the advent of generative AI has made the strategy of unsupervised, high-stakes assessment **no longer viable** without a major overhaul. The future of assessment will likely be a hybrid model that uses supervised exams for knowledge retention and innovative assessments for demonstrating higher-order critical skills.

feel they must use AI to keep up with peers who are cheating?gg
