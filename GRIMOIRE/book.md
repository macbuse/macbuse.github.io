# Genesis

It began with in the beginning there was th elight or so they say.
In my case it was mre complicated. In the beginneing there was no Python I was
there in the void with Basic and some sort of editor. Time passed. Things got
less worse. I had a better editor and a Pascal compiler but it wasn't like being out in the wild. I graduated and moved to terminals, things sucked but at
least there was **vi**. Moved to the States and workstations. More **vi** a bit
of **C** and **PERL**.

The years flashed past and I found a **CD** with **Blender** on a magazine:
- Blender's interface made the Rosetta stone look like peanuts
- But at least  you could script it with **Python**

## Grimoire

Mostly I build stuff in three ways:

- from scratch
- by copy/paste
- by installing (in a venv) then extending

Twenty years ago I mainly did stuff from *scratch* because the Python community
was less **rich**. I was workng either in Blender or doing some sort of basic
scraping (without Beautiful Soup). It was a lot of fun but painful.

At some point Python code became much more freely accessible on
- Stackexchange
- GitHub
- Pypi.org

**Python** code is particularly easy to read. It is quite dense, provided one
uses the idioms as intended, so there  relatively few **LOC**. Though this might seem
unimportant it allows one to understand the overall logic of a code block 
quickly, without scrolling. I do a lot of copy/paste and installing but for
**Numpy** I mostly write from scratch because the notation is so exquisitely
arcane. So what do I mean?

**arcane** (adjective) understood by few; mysterious or secret

Frankly it is a *eldritch* world with *strange* conventions. I make no excuses
this is a grimoire filled with recip√©s for those who wish to be initiated. Some
cchapters will require a certain philosphical adaptaion from the adept. But so
what? Without sacrifice there can be no enlightenment.

## Notes on  notes

I've written these notes on three levels:

- for my grandmother who would be 130 something now
- for my mother who would be 90  
- for my daughter who only cares about her IPhone

My grandmother darned socks which is a lost art, my mother did
advanced dressmaking, even wedding dresses and my daughter enjoyed  building Ikea furniture in her pre teens.

Whilst I like traditional Python notation I think that **Numpy**, whilst
seemingly arcane, has so many advantages is an essential for any serious Python
practioner.

# Programming basics

Everybody has their golden rules:

- keep it simple but explicit
- choose good names


# Python Basics


- lists
- loops
- functions

## Datatypes


- integers
- floats
- strings
- lists


# MatPlotLib

# Numpy for my grandmother

What would I tell my her about **Numpy**?

This is a really difficult question. She had no schooling as far as I know. She could
read with a magnifying glass but nobody had a computer so? In fact she was born
before Turing conceived his notion of a "machine" as such.
