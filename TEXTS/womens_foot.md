Women’s World Cup: five issues holding back the female game


[source](https://theconversation.com/womens-world-cup-five-issues-holding-back-the-female-game-209358)


1. Players and teams are having to fight for fairness
2. Serious injuries are decimating squads
3. The European broadcasting deal came too late
4. Many teams have been poorly supported and prepared
5. Same old patronising marketing strategy

1 and 4 are basically the same thing.
2 and 4 are related in that inadequate support is allegedly the
cause of injuries.
5 could actually be the fault of activists who invariably seek to
portray females as **role models**

1. Players and teams are having to fight for fairness

Before the tournament began, key players from top teams such as France, Spain, Canada and Jamaica were protesting about poor support, resourcing and coaching by either refusing to play or openly criticising their federations and seeking advice from Fifpro, the international players union.

As we have seen in the first few days, this means that many of the key stories of the tournament so far have been about the drama that is happening off the pitch, rather than the dramatic performances on it.

2. Serious injuries are decimating squads

Many players will be missing during the World Cup due to a disproportionately high number of serious injuries that could have been prevented. Research needs to prioritise injury prevention in female athletes, as our current knowledge is largely based on men.

Female-specific equipment is also needed. The notorious anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear (in the knee) and other serious injuries decimating squads have, in part, been connected to overly long studs (cleats) on football boots which are designed for men.


Recent research has also found that 82% of female players reported pain and impaired performance from the available footwear. New “female” football boots are becoming available, but whether these are just female-branded or have substantive science-led changes in design remains unclear.


3. The European broadcasting deal came too late

The media broadcasting rights for five European nations, including England, were only agreed less than six weeks before the tournament began.

This fiasco arose from a blunder by FIFA, whose decision to decouple the men’s and women’s tournament broadcast rights was hyped to show the women’s game had “made it”. But it has proved premature and the low broadcast bids, which Fifa considered “unacceptable”, suggest the male dominated broadcast media remain unconvinced women’s football has much value in its own right.

The delays meant broadcasters had much less time to promote the event and build audience demand and attention than they usually would for major sport tournaments.

It also raises questions about the quality of broadcasts that will be available, which matters because it influences audience perceptions. Broadcast quality can either make women’s football look great or sub-standard – especially compared to the men’s coverage.

4. Many teams have been poorly supported and prepared

Many national federations have failed to provide adequate support, facilities and investment to adequately prepare teams. Coaching methods and management of some women’s teams have been heavily criticised, alongside cancellation of training camps and non-payment of players’ appearance fees.

The England team have made public their frustrations with the Football Association (FA) and its piecemeal negotiations, as they learned that unlike the US and Australian teams, they will not be receiving expected pay bonuses on top of Fifa prize money.

The FA also introduced new measures to restrict their participation in lucrative PR opportunities in the buildup to the tournament to ensure they were rested, only to change their minds when it was too late for players to take advantage. Given that international tournaments make up a large proportion of these players’ earnings, they need to know where they stand – and much further in advance.

5. Same old patronising marketing strategy

The marketing of the tournament has been underwhelming and over-reliant on conventional “inspiration” themes aimed at young girls – strategies that have little proven impact on participation and are often seen as patronising.

The global branding and promotion of the women’s game is typically fixated on two ideas. 
- First, that only young girls are interested. 
- Second, women footballers should be presented as role models for young girls.

This strategy is not accurate, as it obscures the existing adult audience for women’s football. Nor is it desirable or sustainable, as it doesn’t consider attracting wider audiences – men, boys, women without children – to the women’s game.

## Media numbers

Around 1.12 billion viewers tuned into the 2019 Women's World Cup in France across all platforms, FIFA said.

Infantino had said broadcasters initially offered only $1 million-$10 million for the rights for this year's tournament in Australia and New Zealand, compared to $100 million-$200 million for the men's World Cup.
