I found this recipe
[here](https://www.theedgyveg.com/2018/01/08/instant-pot-dal-indian-dal-recipe/)


- 2 Tbsp coconut oil
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp minced ginger
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp garam masala
- ¼ tsp cayenne
- ¼ tsp mustard seeds
- 1½ cups of dried brown or red lentils
- 3 cups water
- ½ tsp salt
- 2 tomatoes, chopped
- ¼ cup fresh cilantro, chopped + extra for garnish


This wasn't creamy enough so I replaced some of the water with coconut milk.
I actually managet to burn the lentils - they stuck to the bottom of tthe bowl:
( maybe use moooore water or scrape the bowl with a wooden spatula to get it
clean before pressure cooking......................

Usual curry prep then:
* pressure cooking time 10 minutes.
* wait 10 mins before opening the pressure valve.

## Mung bean curry

NGREDIENTS
* 4 Tbsp canola oil or other neutral-flavoured oil
* 1 Tbsp whole cumin seeds
* 9 cloves garlic crushed (about 3 Tbsp crushed garlic)
* 14 oz can crushed tomatoes
* 2 Tbsp freshly grated ginger
* 2 Tbsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 1 tsp sea salt
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper
* 4 cups water
* 1 cup mung beans picked over for stones and well rinsed
* 14 oz can coconut milk
* 1-2 medium limes juiced
* 1/2 cup fresh cilantro chopped

1. Using the sauté function, heat your Instant Pot on normal heat. Add the cooking oil, and then add the cumin seeds and cook them for approximately one minute, until they sizzle. 
1. Add the garlic, and sauté for 3-4 minutes until it has browned, but watch it very carefully so that it doesn't burn.
Add the crushed tomatoes and stir to combine, then add ginger, coriander, turmeric, salt, and cayenne. Sauté this mixture for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
1. Add 3 cups of water and the mung beans. Place the lid on your Instant Pot and put on manual pressure cook HIGH setting for 10 minutes. It should take about 15 minutes to come to pressure. 
1. Allow the pressure to release naturally (this should take about 20-30 minutes) and remove the lid once safe.
Stir in the coconut milk, cilantro, and lime juice. Serve!

## Celery soup

I read this
[here](https://www.curryandvanilla.com/celery-soup-with-cumin-and-ginger-pressure-cooker-method/)

Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 teaspoon oil
- ½ tsp cumin seeds/jeera
- 1-inch piece ginger, chopped into large pieces
- 2 to 3 green chillies/jalapenos, slit
- ½ cup green onions (white portion), chopped
- 2 cups chopped celery
- Salt to taste
- Black Pepper powder
- Celery leaves and chopped green onions for garnishing

To make it creamier I added coconut milk as usual.

Usual curry prep then 

- Add celery and cook, stirring, until just starting to soften, about 3 minutes.
- Stir in 1 cup of water, close the pressure cooker and cook on high for 4 or 5 minutes. Once the pressure has dropped, strain the mixture into a saucepan.

I pureed it and didn't do this :

- Remove the slit green chilies and pieces of ginger and blend the rest to a fine puree.
- Transfer the pureed onion-celery mixture to the strained celery broth, add 2 cups of water, season with salt to taste and mix well. Add a pinch of sugar, if needed, to balance the flavors.
- Bring to a boil on high heat and then simmer on medium low for about 5 to 7 minutes.

Instructions

Place a large 8-quart stock pot over medium-high heat. Add the oil and place the onion, garlic, carrots, and ginger in the pot. Sear the veggies on all sides to caramelize, making sure not to burn the garlic.
Pour in the chicken broth, beef broth, and water. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a low boil and simmer for at least one hour.
Use a skimmer to remove the vegetables from the broth. Taste, then salt as needed.
To serve: ladle hot broth into bowls and sprinkle chopped scallion and sliced mushrooms over the top.
