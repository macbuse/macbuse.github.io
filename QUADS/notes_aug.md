Brahmaguptaâ€“Fibonacci identity

The Brahmagupta identity states that the product of two sums of two
squares is again a sum of two squares. It can be expressed as:
$$ (a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2) = (ac+ bd)^2 + (ad-bc)^2$$
It can be expressed in terms of moduli of complex numbers as:
$$|(ai+b)(ci+d)|^2 = |(ac+bd) + (ad-bc)i|^2$$
or the square root of this
$$(ai+b)(-ci+d) = (ac+bd) + (ad-bc)i.$$
It is amusing to note that the 2 dimensional Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is a corollary:

$$\begin{array}{lll}
 \|(a,b)\|^2\|(c,d)\|^2 
&=& (a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2) \\
&\geq& (ac+ bd)^2  \\
&=& |(a,b)\cdot(c,d)|^2
\end{array}
$$

There is also the amusing identity:
$$\frac{ai+b}{ci+d} = \frac{(ac+bd) + (ad-bc)i}{c^2+d^2}.$$

Euler's four-square identity

There is a corresponding identity for sums of four squares, known as
Euler's four-square identity:


$$
\begin{array}{lll}
&& (a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)(p^2+q^2+r^2+s^2)\\
&=& (ap+bq+cr+ds)^2
+(aq-bp-ecs+edr)^2 \\
&+&(ar+ebs-cp-edq)^2
+(as-ebr+ecq-dp)^2
\end{array}
$$
where e=1 or e=-1 .

This identity can also be expressed in terms of moduli of
quaternions:
$$|(a+bi+cj+dk)(p+qi+rj+sk)|^2 = |(ap+bq+cr+ds) + (aq-bp-ecs+edr)i +
(ar+ebs-cp-edq)j + (as-ebr+ecq-dp)k|^2.$$
