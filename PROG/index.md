# Introduction

I suppose you know how to ask Google to translate this page in french - I have
an qwerty keyboard and accents are impossible.

The first class will be just preparation for what we will do then.  I won't be using the Moodle page so much as it is not easy to update unlike GitHub.  You will be learning how to use GitHub later -
it's quite easy.

Please watch the videos. 
You can learn a lot from them.
There will not be so much reading but there will be a lot of watching. 
To begin with the videos will be mostly in french but some subjects are only really explained well in english.

### Friday 12/11

This class online as it is **le pont du 11 novembre**


This week we'll be looking at a simple example of 
- [scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) 
- [crawling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler).

These are the two basic techniques necessary to build a robot like Google uses to index the web.

- [notebook](./reg_exp.ipynb)
- [my ideas](./gph2sites.ipynb)

#### Why?

Well my son told me that 
[everything is about philosophy](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wikipedia-philosophy_n_1093460#:~:text=Everything%20is%20about%20philosophy%2C%20in,%2C%22%20which%20describes%20the%20phenomenon.).

### Friday 29/10

- I talked about 
- my version of [game of life](./life.md)
	- how to get the code for the game of life from [here](https://www.webgamesonline.com/mastermind/index.php) using developer tools in **chrome**.
- here is a [first notebook](./convolutions_etc.ipynb) on convolutions_etc
- here is a [another notebook](./conv_kernels.ipynb) to look at

### Why do this?

well because convolutions allow us to write complicated stuff in a very simple way sometimes.


### Friday 22/10

- Finish the notebook on affine maps
- Draw the Barnsley fern

### Friday 15/10

Here is a [notebook](./matplotlib_episode_two_corr.ipynb) 
with solutions to last week's exercises

And this is the [notebook](./affine_maps.ipynb) to study for this week.

If you really want to do a project on games then look at this 
- [Nash](https://www.theoj.org/joss-papers/joss.00904/10.21105.joss.00904.pdf).
- [documentation](https://nashpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html)


### Friday 8/10

This week we'll do some more graphics and draw some fractals.

- Cantor's staircase
- Barnsley's Fern
- Koch snowflake

We'll be using a lot of **recursion** to build tree structures.

Here is the [a previsional version of the notebook](./matplotlib_episode_two.ipynb) to study.

### Friday 1/10

This is the [correction](./corrections.ipynb) for last week.

And this is the [notebook](./matplotlib_one.ipynb) to study for Friday 1/10.

Watch this video about [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
first.

# Why are we doing this ?

Everybody needs to make graphs and figures for
- reports
- books
- web pages

### Friday 24/9

Here is the [second notebook](./numpy_intro.ipynb).
-- There are some difficult things in it mainly about matrices.
-- There are some excercises at the end of the worksheet.

## Why do this?

Numpy was developed by phycists for doing large numerical calculations.
It is efficient because the loops that we would usually write are
hidden by the API and done in **C**.

It was adapted for doing Data Science and there is a special module for this 
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

A few years ago Google published an API to their neural net framework 
called TensorFlow. The data is fed to the algorithms in [numpy arrays](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy).

Finally, as you will see in the notebook, images are stored as matrices
and elementary image processing can be done using linear algebra and slicing.

### Friday 17/9

Here is the [first notebook](./lists.ipynb) I've prepared - you should go
through it once you have **installed JuPyTer** (see below).

If you are not familiar with Python then try [this notebook](./basic_python.ipynb).



At the end of the **first notebook** there is some code to 
analyse letter frequency in Hamlet.


## Exo

Find another text and analyse it

--- 

## Why do this?

Machine translation has made **big** progress in recent years [read this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809921002745#bb0090)
because of [statistical language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model).

- [word2vec](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/) was the first big advance.
- [BERT](https://towardsml.com/2019/09/17/bert-explained-a-complete-guide-with-theory-and-tutorial/) is the latest from Google
- [GPT3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) is a competitor from OpenAI

For BERT you can try and install it but you need a pretty good computer.

We are only going to do very basic statistics on words
but the Python code is close to what really happens.

- Texts are split up into words
- frequencies of pairs of words are calculated. 

This is done for:

- wikipedia
- novels and newspaper articles
- forums

## Installing Anaconda

We will be using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
because it is convenient and it is really **industry standard** for doing
DataScience. It comes with JuPyTer, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas.

You can follow the instructions on [this
page](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
to install Anaconda on your machine.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVME6JvdD5g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Google Colab

If Anaconda installation doesn't work then sign up for an account to [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). To use this service you will have to
be connected to the internet all the time. 

It is a **good idea** to sign up for this now because Colab is configured for
using GPUs and works well with Deep Learning packages ie Keras/Tensorflow.

## Kaggle

I have a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) account too but I rarely use it. In theory you can follow the
course using a Kaggle account if you have one.

## Getting started

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
- is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. 
- is flexible: configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. 
- is a javascript **front end** running in my browser that interfaces with different **kernels**.

I use Linux/OS X and usually start JuPyteR from a terminal

``` jupyter lab```

Lab is a version of JuPyteR scheduled to replace ```jupyter notebooks```
but there are still some bugs (in particular when using interactive widgets).

When I run ``` jupyter lab``` this appears in the navigator:

![img](jlab.png)

The **kernel sessions** list on the left are recent projects that are automatically opened. On the right there is a window with an open project TTS.ipynb. The file format [ipynb](https://fileinfo.com/extension/ipynb) stands for [Iron Python](https://ironpython.net/) Notebook. If you know about these things then it is really a [json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) file.

You can open a new notebook from the ```File``` menu.

![img](jlab2.png)

The blank retangle is
a [code cell](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)
- you can write python code here and execute it with ```shft-enter```.

There are 2 other kinds of cell
- Markdown for formatted text and math formulas.
- Raw

You can change the cell type from the menu:

![img](jlab3.png)


## Notebooks 

You should read this 
 [tutorial for biomaths](https://python.sdv.univ-paris-diderot.fr/18_jupyter/)
 to get an idea of how notebooks work.

Lots of people use notebooks for swapping and explaining results : 
- [calculating R0](https://github.com/k-sys/covid-19/blob/master/Realtime%20R0.ipynb)
- [data
science](https://www.ionos.fr/digitalguide/sites-internet/developpement-web/jupyter-notebook/)
- [gravitational
waves](https://blog.jupyter.org/congratulations-to-the-ligo-and-virgo-collaborations-from-project-jupyter-5923247be019)
- [LHC particle
physics](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2687389/files/CERN_SUM_PJ_report_Yixin.pdf)



## Further reading

### Python Idioms

Watch the first part about collections and functions.

Here are the 
[slides](https://files.speakerdeck.com/presentations/c56b00e084950130ac8e22000a1c4bc5/BeautifulCode.pdf) in english. The code is Python 2 - so if you want it to work remember that in Python 3 ```print``` is a function!

### Markdown

Read about Markdown [in english](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and
[in french](https://blog.wax-o.com/2014/04/tutoriel-un-guide-pour-bien-commencer-avec-markdown/).
