The same individuals as actors could play different roles, each with its own legal attributes, sometimes even in the same court appearance. \\n', 'According to other sources, which also admit that the origin of the term is not completely clear, <i>persona</i> could be related to the Latin verb <i>per-sonare</i>, literally: <i>sounding through</i>, with an obvious link to the above-mentioned theatrical mask, which often incorporated a small megaphone.\\n', 'According to <a href=\"/wiki/Carl_Jung\" title=\"Carl Jung\">Carl Jung</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Jungian_psychology\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Jungian psychology\">Jungian psychology</a>, the persona is also the mask or appearance one presents to the world.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> It may appear in <a href=\"/wiki/Dream\" title=\"Dream\">dreams</a> under various guises. People may choose to wear a social mask or use a persona to make themselves appear more socially desirable. This is used to impress potential partners or to make new friends.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_4-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> People can have multiple personas that they use in various situations; this can include work, being with friends, at home, etc. Depending on the individual\\'s circumstance, a persona which they consider stronger within their specific social situation can be created because they put a higher emphasis on social interactions. <a href=\"/wiki/Carl_Jung\" title=\"Carl Jung\">Carl Jung</a> warned about using personas too much, fearing that one might lose their own individuality to their persona. A study has shown that this can be true to an extent, when taking a private self-rating test, there is a high correlation between how a person rates themselves and how they present themselves in public. It is difficult to tell if people are accurately filling out the test or answering what they find desirable.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto_4-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-4\">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>\\n', 'In a study written by <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Danielle_Jackson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Danielle Jackson \">Danielle Jackson</a>, she argues that a person\\'s persona can range in healthiness. The more healthy a persona is, the more socially acceptable and consistent that person remains. However, once a person starts to believe they are their persona, it can have adverse effects on their personality.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto1_5-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto1-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> <a href=\"/wiki/James_Hillman\" title=\"James Hillman\">James Hillman</a> believed that once a person loses their identity to a persona, they become an <a href=\"/wiki/Archetypal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Archetypal\">archetypal</a> figure. By losing their \"ego\", their persona becomes their personality in an archetypal form. However, when this occurs, the person becomes unstable and they are unable to act outside their formed persona.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto1_5-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto1-5\">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>\\n', 'In <a href=\"/wiki/Literature\" title=\"Literature\">literature</a>, the term generally refers to a character established by an author, one in whose voice all or part of a narrative takes place. Poets such as <a href=\"/wiki/Robert_Browning\" title=\"Robert Browning\">Robert Browning</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Ezra_Pound\" title=\"Ezra Pound\">Ezra Pound</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/T._S._Eliot\" title=\"T. S. Eliot\">T. S. Eliot</a> are strongly associated with such narrative voices, as is the writer <a href=\"/wiki/Luigi_Pirandello\" title=\"Luigi Pirandello\">Luigi Pirandello</a>. These writers understood the term slightly differently and derived its use and meaning from different traditions. Examples of Eliot\\'s personae were <a href=\"/wiki/Prufrock\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Prufrock\">Prufrock</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Sweeney_Agonistes\" title=\"Sweeney Agonistes\">Sweeney</a>. Pound developed such characters as <a href=\"/wiki/Cino\" title=\"Cino\">Cino</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Bertran_de_Born\" title=\"Bertran de Born\">Bertran de Born</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Propertius\" title=\"Propertius\">Propertius</a>, and <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hugh_Selwyn_Mauberly&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Hugh Selwyn Mauberly \"> Mauberley</a> in response to figures in Browning’s dramatic monologues. Whereas Eliot used \"masks\" to distance himself from aspects of modern life which he found degrading and repulsive, Pound\\'s personae were often poets and could be considered in good part <a href=\"/wiki/Alter-ego\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Alter-ego\">alter-egos</a>. For Pound, the personae were a way of working through a specific poetic problem. In this sense, the persona is a transparent mask, wearing the traits of two poets and responding to two situations, old and new, which are similar and overlapping.\\n', 'In <a href=\"/wiki/Literary_analysis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Literary analysis\">literary analysis</a>, any narrative voice that speaks in the first person and appears to define a particular character is often referred to as a persona. It is contrasted with a third-person narrative voice, generally taken to be more objective and impersonal. There are borderline cases, such as the “we” that occurs late in <a href=\"/wiki/Edwin_Arlington_Robinson\" title=\"Edwin Arlington Robinson\">Edwin Arlington Robinson</a>\\'s poem and functions something like a chorus in a Greek tragedy, but in general any identifiable narrator whose point of view or manner of speaking clearly distinguishes him or her from the author is considered a literary persona.\\n', 'In <a href=\"/wiki/Fan_fiction\" title=\"Fan fiction\">fan fiction</a> and in online stories, the personas may especially reflect the authors\\' <a href=\"/wiki/Self-insertion\" title=\"Self-insertion\">self-insertion</a>.\\n', 'Usually, the performers assume a role that matches the music they sing on <a href=\"/wiki/Stage_\" title=\"Stage \">stage</a>, though they may also be composers. Many performers make use of a persona. Some artists create various characters, especially if their career is long and they go through many changes over time. For example, <a href=\"/wiki/David_Bowie\" title=\"David Bowie\">David Bowie</a> initially adopted a role as alien messenger <a href=\"/wiki/Ziggy_Stardust_\" title=\"Ziggy Stardust \">Ziggy Stardust</a>, and later as <a href=\"/wiki/The_Thin_White_Duke\" title=\"The Thin White Duke\">The Thin White Duke</a>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> More than just artistic <a href=\"/wiki/Pseudonym\" title=\"Pseudonym\">pseudonyms</a>, the personae are independent characters used in the artist\\'s shows and albums .\\n', 'However, in music, a persona does not always mean a change. Some authors have noted that <a href=\"/wiki/Bob_Dylan\" title=\"Bob Dylan\">Bob Dylan</a>\\'s charisma is due largely to his almost stereotyped image, always with a <a href=\"/wiki/Harmonica\" title=\"Harmonica\">harmonica</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Guitar\" title=\"Guitar\">guitar</a>, and with his distinctive hair, nasal voice, and clothing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The persona also serves to claim a right or to draw attention to a certain subject. That is the case of <a href=\"/wiki/Marilyn_Manson\" title=\"Marilyn Manson\">Marilyn Manson</a> and his interest in death and <a href=\"/wiki/Morbidity\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Morbidity\">morbidity</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Madonna\" title=\"Madonna\">Madonna</a> and her interest in sexuality.<sup id=\"cite_ref-8\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>\\n', 'The concept of persona in music was introduced by <a href=\"/wiki/Edward_T._Cone\" title=\"Edward T.
