##  Fundamental Mathematics (FM)

At least since the time of Newton mathematics has been the universal language
of science, and this is especially the case in natural and computational
sciences where its relevance cannot be overstated. Modeling problems that arise
in these domains is an inexhaustible source of mathematical challenges, which
stimulate the development of new mathematical concepts, techniques, and
algorithms, and frequently lead to interesting computational questions.
Conversely, several areas of fundamental mathematics take advantage of
computational tools, for instance in obtaining certified and rigorous formal
demonstrations of celebrated theorems, or checking  the validity of important
conjectures by means of high-performance computing. This virtuous circle
includes almost all areas of mathematics whether that be  algebra, analysis,
combinatorics, geometry, or number theory. For instance, geometry and topology,
often have an important role in modeling physical problems, whilst analytical,
algebraic, or probabilistic techniques have proven indispensable in resolving
the resulting mathematical questions. A goal of the present project is to build
new connections between fundamental mathematics and computational sciences, in
particular in the following directions:

- Develop new mathematical techniques, based on stochastic geometry or
ergodic theory, to fully understand the information contained in large
data sets;
- Apply theoretical studies of error correcting codes to improve the reliability of digital communications and data storage in the
perspective of post-quantum cryptography;
- Extend computer-assisted methods in the direction of geometry by using interval arithmetic to study complex geometrical objects;
- Develop new algorithms and improve existing algorithms for studying the topology and geometry of curves and surfaces.


<!-- b) Modeling, Simulation & Optimization (MSO) -->

<!-- Sitting as it does between fundamental research and applications, applied -->
<!-- mathematics is a pivotal discipline, which aims to develop -->
<!-- theories and techniques that are applicable to many scientific fields. -->
<!-- So it is natural that it has  fostered a multitude of interdisciplinary projects. --> 
<!-- There are  two main specializations involved in this process -->
<!-- are modelling and simulation. Modelling constructs the -->
<!-- most appropriate mathematical description of a problem, to make it -->
<!-- amenable to analysis. Simplification procedures such as dimension -->
<!-- reduction are often needed to allow for a complete analysis or for -->
<!-- efficient computer simulations. As very few “real” problems can be -->
<!-- solved directly, simulations play an essential role and require -->
<!-- appropriate discretizations of the problem to obtain accurate -->
<!-- approximate solutions. Fundamental concepts are used by applied -->
<!-- mathematicians to analyze the problems and optimize the computed -->
<!-- solutions. -->

<!-- Among the goals of this axis, we can mention : -->

<!-- • Discretize and simulate fundamental mathematical problems to -->
<!-- illustrate important theorems or to formulate conjectures based on -->
<!-- numerical results. -->

<!-- • Develop complex modeling for interdisciplinary projects to allow for -->
<!-- predictions and optimizations via simulations. Applications in the -->
<!-- context of PERSYVAL2 include cryptography, simulation of complex -->
<!-- electronic devices, optimization for automatic shape recognition, etc. -->
