# 

300$y' = y,\, y(0) = 1$



!![M](Okay, we're gonna look at a very simple differential equation. 

It's one that you would see on the very first day
of a differential equations class but
we're gonna solve it five different ways.)

# 

300$y' = y,\, y(0) = 1$
!![K](This is one of my favorite problems!
We'll see that it's really  pretty easy!  

I like to put it on the final exam for the class, 
as it helps to build confidence.
But it also  gives a student the  opportunity to
use  all the techniques that they've learned)

#

## Guess and check
>What function is   
it's own derivative?

600$y' = y$

!![M](Our first method is going to be guess
and check.
So we have 
Y prime equals Y  and Y
of zero equals 1.

Now what I mean by
guess and  check is just think through the
catalog of functions that you know and
ask yourself the question:

what function has the
property that when you take their
derivative you get back to it again?)

#
### A solution is....

400$y(x)=e^x \Rightarrow  y' = y$
!![M](It doesn't take  too long to see
that there's a well known  function like that.
It is Y equals E to the X of course. )

#

## Guess and check
>Multiplying by a constant  
gives another solution

400$y(x)=A e^x \Rightarrow  y' = y$

!![K](
Then you say to yourself:
Well I can multiply this by a constant,
and I still get a solution to the equation!)

#

> Initial condition  
> to the rescue

400$y(0)=1  \Rightarrow  A = 1$
400$\Rightarrow  y = e^x$
!![K](
But we've got an initial condition!
If I plug in X equals zero I should get one. 
This tells us  that the constant must be  one.
So the only solution we have is going to be Y equals E to the X!
)

#

## Guess +  Check = Cheesy?
!![M](
Now you might think that it's kind of cheesy to guess
and check a solution, but a lot of really
important mathematics on the cutting
edge happens by guessing and checking!
)

# Done

!![K](
Good!  We've finished our first method. That was easy, wasn't it?
