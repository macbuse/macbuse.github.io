To answer your point about Germany:
- in a functioning market Germany's trade surplus should push up the value of their currency and reduce their competitively.
- in the dysfunctional euro zone the net trade deficit keeps the euro down and Germany remains king of the luxury car market

As for retirement Constantin is right there are 2 systems
- repartition
- capitalisation

both have their advantages and disadvantages. However, the instability of the markets since the deregulation of the Clinton era makes the latter inherently risky. What you get depends on the when you retire in the boom/bust cycle of the markets. And this pushes governments to prop up markets using "tax dollars"Crédit d'impôt recherche when they really shouldn't.

In 2008 the markets had virtually collapsed. Technically speaking there was a liquidity problem in that the banks no longer trusted each other and wouldn't underwrite each other's debts. Technically (all) quoted assets had zero value. So governments recapitalized the banks using bond issues (hence the very low interest rates on government debt) and relaunched the markets using QI (printing money).

It's all financial wizardry. But the debt that they always talk about reducing isn't as is frequently implied the fault of the fonctionnaires - there's a a lot of the QI, the 20 billion of Crédit d'impôt recherche every year and the quoi qu'il en coute.

The "reforming retirement" is a codeword for introducing capitalisation and always has been. I listened to the likes of Elie Cohen talking about this before 2008, convinced that the geniuses in the markets had found a miraculous system to manage/eliminate risk. The retirement at 60 is b$ - the likes of Fabius retired at 57 and Hidalgo at 52. The markets need cash injections to keep the bubbles going and to make sure everyone gets their bonus at Xmas. What better source than those lazy french?
