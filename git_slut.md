# Github Credentials

I was using a password to access via the CLI in Linux.
The 13/8/21 they discontinued this API. Migration was painful.

Updated git CLI to the latest version.

### SSH keys

I generated SSH keys locally and installed it on my machine.

- stored in ~/.ssh

Copy paste to the window on my account failed repeatedly but I think this was because of vi.

**This didn't solve the write access problem***

### GPG access token

This is very poorly documented.

- generated the key on my GitHub account and gave it permissions.
- installed GCM from a .deb, had to restart linux because of a lock that blocked dpkg
- ran GCM to configure
- tried pushing my webpage, got asked to go to the browser to authorize, used password and clicked on the form button

### Try it on another machine
