In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[21] Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the union has developed a role in external relations and defence. It maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20. Due to its global influence, the European Union has been described by some scholars as an emerging superpower.[22][23][24]

### Internal Market

An internal single market has been established through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where the states have agreed to act as one. 

EU policies aim to :
- ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market;
- enact legislation in justice and home affairs;
- and maintain common policies on trade,[11] agriculture,[12] fisheries and regional development.
-

Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area.
A monetary union was established in 1999, coming into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 member states which use the euro currency.
The EU has often been described as a sui generis poitical entity (without precedent or comparison) with the characteristics of either a federation or confederation.

### Treaties

- 1993 (Maastricht) The union and EU citizenship were established when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993.
- 1951 (Paris) The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) 
- 1957 (Rome) the European Economic Community (EEC),
- 2009 (Lisbon)

The original member states of what came to be known as the European Communities were the Inner Six:
    - Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany.

The communities and their successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit. The United Kingdom became the first member state to leave the EU[18] on 31 January 2020. Before this, three territories of member states had left the EU or its forerunners.
