## Why has France declined in PISA results?

Great question. The table you shared is from the **OECD PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment)** results, which track how 15-year-olds perform in mathematics, reading, and science.

The decline in France’s results—especially between 2012 and 2022—is part of a broader trend observed in many OECD countries, but France has been hit harder in some areas. Here are the **main reasons researchers and OECD reports point to**:

---

### 🔹 1. **COVID-19 pandemic effects**

* School closures in 2020–2021 disrupted learning significantly.
* Remote learning quality varied greatly, with disadvantaged students often having less access to digital tools, stable internet, or parental support.
* This widened gaps and led to overall lower performance.

---

### 🔹 2. **Growing socio-economic inequalities**

* The table shows that disadvantaged students lost more ground than advantaged ones.
* Performance gaps between top and bottom socio-economic groups remain **stable but large**, meaning inequality is persistent.
* Many students from disadvantaged backgrounds struggle to recover learning losses.

---

### 🔹 3. **Decline in student engagement and motivation**

* OECD surveys show French students often report **low enjoyment of learning**, particularly in math.
* Anxiety around testing and school pressure is relatively high in France, which affects outcomes.

---

### 🔹 4. **Systemic challenges in education**

* Teaching methods in France have been criticized as too focused on rote learning, leaving less room for problem-solving and critical thinking (key in PISA).
* High-achieving students also saw declines, suggesting systemic issues rather than just socio-economic ones.

---

### 🔹 5. **International context**

* The decline is not unique to France: most OECD countries saw drops in performance between 2018 and 2022.
* But France’s decline in **reading** (-31 points over 10 years) is sharper than the OECD average, which is concerning.

---

✅ **Summary**:
The decline comes from a mix of **pandemic learning loss, persistent inequalities, low student engagement, and systemic issues in teaching practices**. Both high- and low-achieving students lost ground, which shows the problem is broad, not only about disadvantaged groups.

## Comparing France to East Asia in PISA

That’s a really insightful point — and it gets to the heart of how **culture, teaching methods, and expectations** shape learning.

Asian countries (like Singapore, Japan, Korea, and China’s provinces) tend to consistently outperform in PISA, not just because of raw ability but because of **deeply different approaches to education compared to France**. Let’s break it down:

---

### 🔹 1. **Cultural attitudes toward education**

* In many East Asian societies, education is tied closely to **family honor, future success, and social mobility**.
* Parents, teachers, and students often see effort (hard work) as more important than talent.
* In France, education is valued, but students often report **lower motivation and enjoyment**, and learning is sometimes perceived as a burden rather than a path to success.

---

### 🔹 2. **Teaching and classroom practices**

* East Asian teaching often emphasizes **practice, mastery, and collective progress**, with a strong belief that “every student can succeed if they try.”
* In France, teaching is more **theoretical and abstract** (especially in math), and failure can feel like a permanent label rather than part of learning.
* French students often describe the classroom climate as **stressful and competitive**, which discourages weaker students instead of motivating them.

---

### 🔹 3. **Support systems**

* In Asia, long study hours, after-school tutoring (cram schools, “juku” in Japan, “hagwon” in Korea, “buxiban” in China), and parental involvement keep students engaged.
* In France, extra support is less widespread and more tied to socio-economic status. A struggling student from a low-income family often has fewer resources (no private tutoring, limited parental help).

---

### 🔹 4. **Perception of effort vs. ability**

* **Asia:** Success = effort. Struggling means “work harder.”
* **France:** Success often = “innate ability.” Struggling students may internalize failure as “I’m just not good at math/reading.”
* This difference shapes motivation profoundly.

---

### 🔹 5. **Student well-being paradox**

Interestingly, PISA shows that Asian students are **high-achieving but report high stress**, while French students are **lower-achieving but also report high stress**.

* Asian stress often fuels perseverance (study more).
* French stress often fuels disengagement (give up, feel it’s pointless).

---

✅ **In short:**
Asian students remain engaged because **cultural expectations, strong support systems, and a belief in effort** keep them motivated, even under stress.
French students, by contrast, face a system that emphasizes theory, labels failure harshly, and provides unequal support — so stress leads to **disengagement rather than persistence**.

---

Yes — excellent observation 👌.
The **centralized nature of the French education system** (where the government dictates curricula, teaching methods, and exams nationwide) is often seen as both a strength and a weakness. And you’re right: it contributes to the difficulties French students face.

Here’s how:

---

### 🔹 1. **Rigid, centralized curriculum**

* France has one of the most **centralized education systems in the OECD**.
* Every student follows the same national curriculum, designed in Paris, with little room for local adaptation.
* This ensures **equality of access** in theory, but in practice, it leaves little flexibility for teachers to adjust lessons to student needs, interests, or real-life applications.
* Result: many students feel disconnected, especially those who don’t thrive in abstract, theoretical teaching.

---

### 🔹 2. **Focus on abstract theory over practical skills**

* French curricula (especially in math and science) are **highly academic and abstract**.
* By contrast, PISA tests focus on **real-world problem solving** (e.g., applying math to daily situations).
* This mismatch partly explains why France’s PISA scores are declining: students may learn formal concepts but struggle to apply them.

---

### 🔹 3. **One-size-fits-all teaching**

* Centralized dictates mean less differentiation for struggling students.
* Teachers have limited autonomy to adapt pace, content, or style to their class’s specific needs.
* In countries with more decentralized systems (like Finland or Canada), teachers can innovate and personalize learning more effectively.

---

### 🔹 4. **Exam-driven system**

* France’s education is heavily focused on **exams and grades** (Brevet, Baccalauréat).
* This encourages rote learning for tests rather than deep understanding.
* Students who fall behind early often become disengaged, since the system doesn’t allow much flexibility for catching up.

---

### 🔹 5. **Teacher workload and morale**

* Centralized directives and frequent curriculum reforms (decided by ministries, not teachers) often frustrate teachers.
* Many report feeling undervalued and constrained, which can affect classroom engagement and student motivation.

---

✅ **So yes, the centralization has a negative effect.**
While it guarantees some equality of instruction, it also makes the system **rigid, exam-oriented, and disconnected from real-life skills**, which contributes to lower engagement and declining results.

---

Perfect — here’s a short comparison of **why Finland and Singapore perform better** despite having very different systems:

---

## Better PISA Results: Finland and Singapore

Here’s a clear **comparison table (France vs Finland vs Singapore)** showing why results differ:

| Feature | 🇫🇷 France | 🇫🇮 Finland | 🇸🇬 Singapore |
|----------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **System type** | Centralized, rigid curriculum dictated by government | Decentralized, teacher autonomy within broad guidelines | Centralized, but adaptive and research-driven |
| **Teaching style** | Abstract, theoretical, exam-focused | Student-centered, personalized, focus on well-being | Rigor + applied problem-solving, emphasis on mastery |
| **Role of teachers** | Constrained by national directives, frequent reforms | Highly trusted professionals with freedom to adapt | Highly trained, respected, continuous development |
| **Testing & evaluation** | Heavy reliance on grades/exams (Brevet, Bac) | Minimal standardized testing, focus on formative assessment | National exams exist, but aligned with real-world skills |
| **Student engagement** | Stressful, competitive climate; disengagement common | Less stress, supportive atmosphere, high motivation | High pressure, but strong culture of effort and support |
| **Equity & support** | Strong inequalities by socio-economic background | Strong safety nets for disadvantaged students | Extra tutoring widely available, few left behind |
| **Outcomes (PISA)** | Declining, especially in reading & math | Consistently above average, strong equity | World-leading in all subjects |

👉 This shows that **France has centralization without flexibility**, Finland thrives on **teacher autonomy and equity**, and Singapore succeeds with **centralization + adaptability + strong support systems**.

Would you like me to also add a **short “lessons France could learn” section** under the table?


### 🇫🇮 Finland

Finland has a **decentralized education system** where teachers have significant autonomy over what and how they teach. Instead of rigid national prescriptions, broad curriculum guidelines allow teachers to adapt lessons to their students’ needs. The system emphasizes **equity, well-being, and personalized learning**, with minimal standardized testing and strong support for struggling students. As a result, students feel less stress, remain engaged, and perform well in real-world problem-solving, even though they spend fewer hours in school than many peers worldwide.

---

### 🇸🇬 Singapore

Singapore is highly **centralized**, but unlike France, its system is **adaptive and future-oriented**. The government continuously updates curricula based on research, labor market needs, and feedback from schools. Teachers receive excellent training and are respected as professionals, and the system places strong emphasis on **both academic rigor and applied problem-solving**. Beyond school, students have widespread access to tutoring and support, ensuring that few fall behind. This combination of **structured national direction, high-quality teaching, and strong support systems** explains why Singapore consistently tops PISA rankings.

---

## Teacher Morale and its impact on PISA Results

That’s a really important angle — because teacher morale directly affects student engagement and learning outcomes. In France, the **centralized, rigid system** has several negative effects on teacher morale:

---

### 🔹 1. **Low professional autonomy**

* Teachers must strictly follow national curricula and exam requirements, leaving little room to adapt teaching to their students’ needs.
* Frequent top-down reforms from the Ministry (often changing with each government) create frustration: teachers feel like “technicians of policy” rather than trusted professionals.

---

### 🔹 2. **Heavy workload and administrative pressure**

* Besides teaching, French teachers face growing administrative tasks, constant curriculum adjustments, and exam preparation.
* Large class sizes (especially in secondary schools) make it harder to provide individualized support.
* Many teachers report burnout, especially in disadvantaged schools (REP/REP+).

---

### 🔹 3. **Perceived lack of recognition**

* Compared to peers in countries like Finland or Singapore, French teachers often feel **undervalued socially and financially**.
* OECD data shows French teacher salaries are below the OECD average relative to other professions with similar qualifications.
* Media and political discourse often frame education problems as “teacher failures,” which undermines morale further.

---

### 🔹 4. **Erosion of authority in classrooms**

* Teachers frequently report difficulties with discipline and student behavior, particularly in socio-economically disadvantaged areas.
* Centralized policies leave little flexibility to adapt discipline methods locally, which increases feelings of helplessness.

---

### 🔹 5. **Impact on recruitment and retention**

* Low morale contributes to a **teacher shortage crisis** in France. Fewer young people want to enter the profession, and many early-career teachers quit within the first 5 years.
* This creates a vicious cycle: shortages increase workload and stress for remaining teachers.

---

✅ **In short:** The French system’s **rigid centralization, constant reforms, heavy workload, and lack of recognition** undermine teacher morale. Teachers feel undervalued and disempowered, which directly impacts classroom climate and student outcomes.

## Prospects for Improvement in PISA results

Excellent question — and it’s one French policymakers and education researchers have been debating for years. Based on what we know from PISA data, OECD reports, and comparisons with high-performing systems, here are some **key changes that could help both students and teachers in France**:

---

## 🔹 1. Give Teachers More Autonomy & Trust

* **Problem now:** Teachers are bound to rigid national curricula and frequent top-down reforms.
* **Change:** Move towards a **framework curriculum** (broad goals and competencies) instead of prescriptive lesson-by-lesson mandates.
* **Effect:** Teachers can adapt lessons to student needs, feel more respected, and be more innovative. Students get more engaging, relevant learning.

---

## 🔹 2. Reduce Over-Reliance on Exams

* **Problem now:** The system is dominated by exams (Brevet, Baccalauréat), which encourages rote learning and creates stress.
* **Change:** Shift towards **formative assessment** (continuous feedback, portfolios, project-based evaluation).
* **Effect:** Students build deeper understanding and critical thinking; teachers can focus on growth, not just grades.

---

## 🔹 3. Modernize Teaching Methods

* **Problem now:** Heavy focus on abstract theory (especially in math/science), misaligned with real-world skills tested by PISA.
* **Change:** Integrate **problem-solving, collaboration, and applied learning** (as in Singapore and Finland).
* **Effect:** Students stay engaged, gain skills they can transfer to real life, and close the gap with top performers internationally.

---

## 🔹 4. Address Inequalities More Effectively

* **Problem now:** Socio-economic status strongly predicts success in France; disadvantaged students fall behind early.
* **Change:** Invest more in **support for struggling schools (REP/REP+), tutoring programs, and early interventions** (as Finland does).
* **Effect:** Narrow achievement gaps, improve equity, reduce teacher stress in disadvantaged areas.

---

## 🔹 5. Improve Teacher Recognition & Working Conditions

* **Problem now:** Teachers feel undervalued, overworked, and underpaid compared to peers in other OECD countries.
* **Change:**

  * Raise teacher salaries (to OECD median at least).
  * Reduce administrative burden.
  * Offer stronger professional development and mentoring.
* **Effect:** Higher morale, easier recruitment and retention, more stable classrooms for students.

---

## 🔹 6. Strengthen Student Engagement & Well-being

* **Problem now:** French students report low motivation and high anxiety.
* **Change:** Promote **active learning, well-being programs, and supportive classroom climates** rather than purely competitive ones.
* **Effect:** Students become more motivated, less stressed, and more resilient learners.

---

✅ **Summary:**
France would benefit from **loosening central control, reducing exam pressure, modernizing pedagogy, tackling inequalities, and valuing teachers more**. The goal is to move from a system that feels **rigid and stressful** to one that is **flexible, equitable, and motivating** — for both students and teachers.

---

Great 👍 — here’s a realistic **10-year roadmap** for reforming the French education system to improve both **student outcomes** and **teachers’ working conditions**.
